{"dataset": "lima", "id": "lima_269", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How slicing in Python works? Please include references where appropriate."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The syntax is:\n\n```\na[start:stop]  # items start through stop-1\na[start:]      # items start through the rest of the array\na[:stop]       # items from the beginning through stop-1\na[:]           # a copy of the whole array\n```\n\nThere is also the `step` value, which can be used with any of the above:\n```\na[start:stop:step] # start through not past stop, by step\n```\nThe key point to remember is that the `:stop` value represents the first value that is not in the selected slice. So, the difference between `stop` and `start` is the number of elements selected (if `step` is 1, the default).\n\nThe other feature is that `start` or `stop` may be a negative number, which means it counts from the end of the array instead of the beginning. So:\n```\na[-1]    # last item in the array\na[-2:]   # last two items in the array\na[:-2]   # everything except the last two items\n```\nSimilarly, `step` may be a negative number:\n```\na[::-1]    # all items in the array, reversed\na[1::-1]   # the first two items, reversed\na[:-3:-1]  # the last two items, reversed\na[-3::-1]  # everything except the last two items, reversed\n```\n\nPython is kind to the programmer if there are fewer items than you ask for. For example, if you ask for ```a[:-2]``` and ```a``` only contains one element, you get an empty list instead of an error. Sometimes you would prefer the error, so you have to be aware that this may happen.\n\n## Relationship with the ```slice``` object\n\nA slice object can represent a slicing operation, i.e.:\n```\na[start:stop:step]\n```\nis equivalent to:\n```\na[slice(start, stop, step)]\n```\n\nSlice objects also behave slightly differently depending on the number of arguments, similarly to ```range()```, i.e. both ```slice(stop)``` and ```slice(start, stop[, step])``` are supported. To skip specifying a given argument, one might use ```None```, so that e.g. ```a[start:]``` is equivalent to ```a[slice(start, None)]``` or ```a[::-1]``` is equivalent to ```a[slice(None, None, -1)]```.\n\nWhile the ```:```-based notation is very helpful for simple slicing, the explicit use of ```slice()``` objects simplifies the programmatic generation of slicing."}]}

{"dataset": "lima", "id": "lima_765", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How to speak english?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "English is a language which is spoken all around the world, and learning to speak it can help you meet new people and advance your career. Learning to speak English can be hard, but with practice and patience, you can become fluent in your new language.\n\n## Get the basics down\n\n1. Start simple. Very few people are true beginners when it comes to English. \"Hello,\" \"hi,\" \"How are you?\" and numerals have infiltrated most societies. Odds are you know more English than you think. Take what you know. For example, \"How are you?\" That uses the verb \"to be.\" What are other questions just like this? Take what you know and expand it! How is she?How is your father?How are your children?How is the weather? Start memorizing verbs. The top ten most common verbs in English are the following: \"be,\" \"have,\" \"do,\" \"say,\" \"get,\" \"make,\" \"go,\" \"know,\" \"take,\" and \"see.\" Just knowing these verbs can get you through a lot of basic conversations. English is subject-verb-object, in that order. Your subject pronouns are: \"I,\" \"you,\" \"he\"/\"she\"/\"it,\" \"we,\" \"you,\" \"they.\" Object pronouns in English are: \"me,\" \"you,\" \"him\"/\"her\"/\"it,\" \"us,\" \"you,\" \"them.\" With those verbs and knowing English is SVO, what sentences can you come up with? I know her.She makes it.He takes us.\n2. Practice conversations. Once you have basic subject and object pronouns down and a handful of verbs, you can start asking questions. Questions often open with \"who,\" \"what,\" \"when,\" \"where,\" \"why,\" and \"how.\" \"Who\" indicates a person; \"what\" indicates a thing; \"when\" indicates a time; \"where\" indicates a place; \"why\" indicates a reason; \"how\" indicates a manner. Say you know the subjects, some basic nouns, those ten verbs, and these question starters. What are some things you could ask an English speaker? What is your name?What do you do?When is your birthday?Where is she?Why do you have it?How do you know?\n\n\n## Get familiar with the grammar\n\n1. Start with the present tenses. Let's start with present simple and present continuous:\n\t* Present simple is used for facts and habits. If you are describing something that is true or something that happens often, opt for the present simple. I go to work every day.She eats breakfast at 7.China is a big country. Present continuous is used for things that are happening right now. There are two verbs: a helper and a main verb. The helper is \"am\"/\"is\"/\"are\" (depending on the subject) and the main verb is any verb with -ing:\n\t* You are reading.I am typing.He is watching TV.\n2. Move to the past and future tenses. Once you've mastered the present, get started on the past and future tenses. We're just going to go over the basic ones now:\n\t* Use the past simple for any event that happened in the past at a specific time. I saw that movie last year.She died on a plane.We went to the bank yesterday. For the future, let's keep it simple. Add a future time marker, and just use the present continuous! It can double as a future tense, too. They are making a cake tomorrow.You are leaving in May.I am going at 6 pm.\n3. Put your adjectives before nouns. Always, always, always put the adjective (the word that describes) before the noun. Always! In fact, there's even an order within adjectives:\n\t* There are eight basic types of adjectives: opinion, size, age, shape, color, origin, material, and purpose. If you have more than one, they go in that order. So, it's a \"huge, round, metal bowl\" or a \"small, red sleeping bag.\"\n\n\n## Maintain progress\n\n1. Label everything. Take the objects in your house and label them with their English equivalent. The goal is to get your mind thinking in English. When it's right there, it'll be impossible to ignore. When you've labeled everything and find yourself thinking, \"Where is my blanket?\" try to think of the word (or sentence) in English. When you find your blanket, were you right? Don't write on the objects--grab a slip of paper and tape it on sturdily.\n2. Keep an eye on your pronunciation. It's very easy to get caught up in memorizing words when pronunciation can be just as important. Unfortunately, English has exceptions to most rules. But there are still some general guidelines you can abide by:\n\t* Always say the last sounds in the word. Certain Asian dialects find this rather difficult. If you know you're guilty of this, keep it in mind. \"Streets\" is not pronounced stree. The \"ts\" is very important in retaining meaning. Take the sentence \"I project the project will end soon.\" Confusing, huh? Isn't English SVO? Yes, and this sentence is too. The first \"project\" (verb) is pronounced pro-JECT; the second (noun) is pronounced PRO-ject. The same is true for all verb-noun pairs: nouns stress the first syllable, verbs the second. Though there are definite exceptions, most nouns in English have the first syllable stressed. Think of the nouns in your house: \"BED-room,\" \"BATH-room,\" \"KITCH-en,\" \"TA-ble,\" \"WIN-dow,\" \"SO-fa,\" \"WA-ter,\" \"JACK-et,\" \"TOI-let,\" etc.\n3. Pick a dialect. There are meaningful differences between American, British, and Australian English. Before you go about increasing your vocabulary, which one appeals to you? Sometimes it's very important to know who you're speaking to. If you tell an American, Canadian, or Australian you're not wearing pants, they might wonder if you're wearing shorts, a dress, a skirt, or just in your underwear. If you tell a British person you're not wearing pants, you're going commando! In addition to vocabulary differences, the pronunciation differences are huge. Know these variations exist before you get confused with multiple correct pronunciations. Certain dictionaries use British English and certain dictionaries prefer American. Choose the one that's best for you.\n\n\n## Use your resources\n\n1. Get a good dictionary. If you need to, get several. A dictionary to translate between your first language and English is best, in addition to a dictionary in English only. Get a pocket-sized version for when you're on the go and that pesky word you keep forgetting comes up.\n2. Speak in English with native speakers. Though it may be tempting to speak with your other friends who are learning too, you'll see the quickest results if you converse mainly with native speakers. Hire a tutor or private teacher. Make sure they're native and have the accent you want. Choose someone with teaching experience--just because you can speak a language does not mean you can teach it. If a teacher isn't up your alley, get a penpal!\n3. Use the internet. There are literally hundreds upon hundreds of sites you can use to your benefit. Anything to make grammar more exciting is welcome--there are games and videos galore. Such resources can be found at Simple English Wikipedia, the British Council, and English Club, among many others. YouTube doesn't have to be about funny animals and popular music. Tap into its educational resources as well.\n4. Watch TV, listen to songs, and read books. Though your goal is to speak English, you have to be able to understand it, too! Even when you're alone and not stuck in a grammar exercise you can keep your mind primed. Start with children's books and TV shows. The language is simpler and will go slower. Eventually, move to channels catered to your interests. If you enjoy cooking, graduate to the Food Network and see what you can pick up on. Try not to turn on the captions! If you have a DVR, record the shows. That way you can go back and work through the dialogue and conversations at your own pace. Listen to English music! Ballads go quite slowly and the refrains can be rather repetitive. Your vocabulary will naturally expand, too.\n5. Think in English. If you find yourself thinking something simple in you native tongue, what would its equivalent be in English? Make a habit of this for maintenance and memory. Think out loud if helps. Explain to your roommates or family what you're trying to do; maybe they'll want to catch on, too! Eventually, simple phrases will become par for the course.\n"}]}
{"dataset": "lima", "id": "lima_779", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How to start a food delivery business?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Food-delivery businesses are a popular and fast-growing field. These businesses typically thrive in college towns, large cities, or other areas where large populations of adults are willing to pay to have food from restaurants delivered to them. The basic business model for this type of business is to approach local restaurants and ask to deliver their food, then charge a small commission for your company's profit. Build a small fleet of delivery drivers, and set up a website or app that your clients can use to order.\n\n## Strategizing and register your business\n\n1. Structure your business as an LLC to protect your finances. There are a variety of ways to structure a small business, but an LLC is one of the most common since it allows you to keep personal finances and business finances separate. To form your LLC, you'll need to file “Articles of Incorporation” with your state's secretary of state. Also, make sure that your company's name ends in “LLC” and open a bank account under the company's name. Most LLCs are “member-managed,” meaning that all of the LLC's owners take an equal share in managing the company. If you were to not structure your business as an LLC, the bank (or other debtors) could come after your personal finances and savings if your business went bankrupt.\n2. Find a source to finance your business if necessary. When you're starting up your business, you may need financing in order to purchase delivery vehicles, rent office space, and pay for insurance and permits. If this is the case, finance your business by taking out a bank loan. Or, see if you can find prospective investors who may be interested in a chunk of your company's future stock. On the other hand, if you have several thousand dollars in savings and plan to start with just 2–3 drivers (with their own vehicles) and yourself, you probably don't need any financing.\n3. Select a catchy name that will stick in your customers' minds. You only get 1 chance to name your business, so make sure to select a name that describes your company. The name itself should also clue people in to some of your business's selling points. A clever name is also a great way to set yourself apart from some of your competitors. For instance, if you want to alert potential customers to your affordably-priced meals, use a word like “affordable” or “budget” in your company name. Avoid bland or forgettable names like “Chicago Lunch Delivery.” Instead, try something snappier, like, “On-Time People Food Delivery,” “Sandwich in a Crunch Delivery,” or “Fine Dining 2 You Food Delivery.”\n4. Register your business with your state and local governments. Before you can begin conducting any business, you'll need to register your delivery company. Specifically, you need to register the business name with your local (and maybe state) government. If you live in the U.S., start the registration process by visiting the website for the secretary of state for the state you reside in. You'll also need to register to obtain a federal tax ID number. Registering your business name prevents others from using it. Registration also ensures that you'll receive legal and tax benefits as well as personal liability protection.\n5. Buy general liability insurance and any other kinds your state requires. Nearly all large insurance companies offer general liability business insurance. Speak to a representative from the company of your choice and ask them what level of insurance you're required to have in order to comply with state guidelines. Besides general liability, many states also require that you obtain workers' compensation insurance to protect the livelihoods of your employees.\n6. Obtain the required permits and licenses to operate in your state. If you live in the U.S., the licenses and permits you'll need in order to run a food-delivery business will vary from state to state. The state permits you need will also with your business's location and activities. Figure out which permits and licenses you'll need by checking out your state's secretary of state website. Your insurance company representative should also be able to advise you regarding the permits you'll need to file for. There may also be various fees associated with obtaining the permits and licenses. Unless you're planning to deliver alcoholic beverages, you shouldn't need to obtain any federal licenses.\n7. Calculate an operating budget for your delivery business. Add up all of your business's prospective expenditures, including renting office space (if applicable), driver salaries, insurance, and gas/vehicle costs. Offset these by calculating your business's prospective income. Figure out how much money you can afford to spend on a monthly basis without going into the red. You can further break the budget up by separating necessary expenses (e.g., rent) from optional expenses (e.g., extra advertising) and finding ways to spend less on the optional expenses. As with any kind of business startup, you won't begin turning a profit right away. It may take a couple of years. Broadly speaking, startup costs for a food-delivery business average between $3,000-$25,000 USD. In most cases, this money will need to come out of your pocket. Also factor your employees' salaries into your budget. While you may start out paying delivery drivers minimum wage, advertising and graphic-design specialists will need salaries. Do some research online to calculate reasonable salary amounts that exceed the annual cost of living in your area.\n\n\n## Partner and arrange deliveries\n\n1. Cater to a specific market and demographic that you'd like to work with. Consider your potential client base. This will influence the type of restaurants that you approach about delivering their food. If you're undecided, drive around the area you live in and take note of the types of restaurants—and restaurant clients—that you see. Especially when you're first starting out, it makes sense to capitalize on the food markets that are already in place. This will also help you find a niche for your business, rather than attempting to serve too broad of a market. For example, ask yourself things like:\n\t* Do you want to sell cheap eats to hungry college kids? Or would you rather deliver gourmet meals to upscale town home residents? Alternately, would you prefer to deliver affordable lunches to businesspeople in an office-heavy district?\n2. Map out the delivery area that you'd like to serve. Whether you live in a large city or are delivering in a rural area, you'll need to decide on a reasonably-sized delivery area. Clients will expect your company to deliver their food promptly (within, say, 15–30 minutes), so you can start by setting a 15-minute radius around your delivery headquarters. Pick 2 or 3 neighborhoods and expand from there. Honing in on 1 or 2 specific parts of town is a great way to build a niche for your business. Even if people across town haven't heard of your company, people in the neighborhoods you cater to will be familiar with your delivery service! You can also decide on a delivery area based on the location of the people you hope to deliver to. For example, if you'll deliver fast lunches to busy businesspeople, look into focusing on densely-concentrated business centers or corporate campuses. Or, if you want to deliver late-night food to college kids, center your deliveries around student housing and affordable apartments in student-heavy areas of town.\n3. Meet with restaurant managers to discuss delivery partnerships. Start small by selecting 2 or 3 local restaurants that you think would appeal to your target audience. Ideally, the restaurants should be centrally located within your delivery area. Call and ask to meet with the manager. When you meet, explain that you're starting a food-delivery business to a lucrative audience and that you'd like to deliver their food. Explain to the managers that you won't be taking money from them; rather, you'll be establishing a partnership that should increase their profits. For example, if you're focusing on an upscale audience, start out by delivering food from a local 3- and 4-star restaurants. Avoid reaching out to chain restaurants, and instead focus on a diverse representation of your city's fine dining. Make it clear to the restaurants that your company holds many of the same values that their does. For example, explain that your company cares about healthy food access and food sustainability. Also ask each manager for a copy of the restaurant's menu to post on your website.\n4. Set a reasonable commission to receive on each order delivered. Food-delivery businesses make money by receiving a commission from the orders they deliver. But, the restaurants still need to make money off of the food they sell. When you sit down with each restaurant manager, hash out a commission amount that will let you keep your business afloat but not keep the restaurant from making profits. Try calculating various commission percentages based on the total amount of sales you hope to make in 1 month. The restaurant itself will pay the commission to your food-delivery business. For example, you may figure out that a 15% commission allows both you and the restaurant(s) to turn a profit. On the other hand, a 20% commission might cut too deeply into the restaurant's profits and a 10% commission might not allow your company to balance its budget.\n5. Choose a flat-rate delivery fee to charge customers on all orders. A flat-rate delivery fee, paid by your customers, will help your business turn a profit and can be used to pay your drivers. Select a low enough dollar amount that it won't deter customers from ordering food in the first place! Setting a delivery fee of $5–7 USD would be a good starting point. It would also be wise to set a minimum order amount. For example, you could require that customers pay at least $15 USD for their delivered meal.\n6. Designate a location to serve as the hub of your delivery business. Your business will need to have a headquarters, from which you can dispatch drivers and too which they'll return after each delivery. It's fine if this location is initially in your garage or out of the back of your apartment. However, as the company grows, be on the lookout for cheap office space or a cheap storefront to rent. This will allow you to expand and grow the business. Specify this primary location on your business cards and website so your customers know roughly where you're based. As your company grows, you can also set up offices for on-site personnel who aren't directly associated with food delivery (e.g., web specialists and advertisers).\n7. Hire delivery drivers who can start delivering food to clients. Delivery drivers will form the backbone of your delivery company, so you'll need to hire several before you can start delivering food. When you bring in the prospective drivers to interview them, make sure that each of the drivers has their own car and a legal driver's license. Ask the prospective hires about their availability, and make sure they understand that the majority of their working hours would fall on nights and weekends. It would also be wise to run a background check on each of the drivers to make sure they don't have a criminal history. If you're a student or live in a college town, try posting “Help Wanted” ads in your student or local newspaper. If you'd like to hire more drivers—say, 20–30 people—post a job ad online in forums like Indeed and Monster to attract many applicants.\n8. Post job ads and hire people to fill other key company positions. Your food-delivery business will need an accountant to handle financial issues and a graphic-design specialist to come up with a company logo and design the website. As your driver base grows, you may need someone to oversee all of the drivers and manage their schedules, and someone to handle PR with the restaurants. Try posting job ads online through LinkedIn, Monster, and Indeed to find qualified individuals to hire. If you're starting the business out as a tiny, at-home operation, you may be able to fill all of these positions by yourself initially. However, the sooner you hire other employees, the faster your business will be able to grow and profit.\n\n\n## Deliver food and advertise your business\n\n1. Develop a website that lets users select a restaurant and purchase food. When your business is first starting out, the website can be straightforward. It should clearly present the different restaurant options whose food your business can deliver. After users select an option, the website can present the delivery options, each marked clearly with a price tag. Then, let users select their delivery address and entire their payment info to conclude each order. Design your website so that it's visually appealing and user friendly. If you don't know anything about coding, don't worry. There are plenty of website hosting pages that let you build websites for free. Check out options like Wix and WordPress.\n2. Create a companion app that functions similarly to the website. Many users—especially younger people—prefer to order their food via app, rather than using a web browser. It's okay if you launch your business without the app in place, but aim to get the app up and running within the first 6 months. Like the webpage, the app should allow customers to select their restaurant and food options, input a delivery address, and pay using a credit card. The Apple and Android app stores are the most popular, so start by making your app available on those markets. Let users download the app for free at first. Once your business starts turning a profit and becomes well known, you can charge for the app if you like.\n3. Establish pickup and delivery workflows for incoming orders. The workflow process should be streamlined and set in stone before you start taking orders. Once a customer places an order online, someone from your business will need to call the respective restaurant and place the order. Then, dispatch a driver to pick up the food and deliver it to the customer. If the restaurants you're working with have sophisticated-enough computer systems, you may also be able to link their computers with the app and website directly. This will save you (or another employee) from having to relay customers' orders over the phone.\n4. Market your business through social media accounts. Social media is a great—and free—way to spread the word about your up-and-coming food-delivery business. Start with Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Reach out and like, follow, and friend people you know on all 3 platforms. Then, start posting! You can post pictures of your drivers, photos of tasty-looking meals, and screenshots of your website. Invite customers to leave positive reviews of your business in the “Comments” section of Facebook and Instagram to build up your online credibility. You could also advertise your business in local papers, or create a radio ad to air on local stations.\n5. Advertise your business through flyers and physical mailers. Online advertising is great, but you should have physical ads as well. Print out flyers and staple or tape them to telephone poles throughout the neighborhoods you'd like to deliver food to. Also try plastering your company's logo all over your delivery containers and menus! Consider printing stickers that have your company's name or logo on them, and placing 1 or 2 in each delivery bag.\n6. Post ads at the locations of restaurants you've partnered with. As long as you're already in business with 2–3 restaurants around town, take advantage of their store space by putting up ads. For example, pin a few flyers on the store bulletin board. Or, ask the store if they can paint their windows to display your company's logo or name. You could even see if the store would be willing to pass out your fliers with every order they sell. Of course, make sure to get the store manager's permission before putting up any ads.\n7. Place advertisements in local community papers and newsletters. You want to get your company's advertisements in front of as many people's eyes as possible. Community newsletters and locally-circulated papers are great venues to use. They're cheaper to advertise in than widely-circulated papers. Plus, you can target your advertisements to the specific areas you'd like to deliver food to. For example, say you often deliver breakfasts and lunches to a large corporate campus. Reach out to the campus administrator and find out if they have an employee newsletter than you could place an ad in.\n"}]}
{"dataset": "lima", "id": "lima_649", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How to look up a bible verse?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "People quote the Bible in a variety of contexts. If you want to be able to look those quotes up, you’ll need to understand the way the Bible is organized. It’s also possible to look up quotes without knowing their location. Simply knowing a couple of words from a verse can be enough to help you locate it if you know how.\n\n## Look up a verse by number\n\n1. Identify the book of the verse. When Bible verses are listed, the first thing you’ll see is the name of a book. Use the table of contents in your Bible to locate that book within it. The table of contents is at the beginning of the Bible. Locate the name in the table of contents and turn to the page associated with the start of the book. The name of the book might be abbreviated or spelled out completely. Some books include:\n\t* Exodus (Ex)\n\t* Genesis (Gen)\n\t* Numbers (Num)\n2. Identify the chapter. After the book name, you’ll see two numbers. The first number is the chapter. For example, in “John 3:16”, “3” is the chapter number. Look at the verse and determine which chapter it is from in the book. Some people may cite Bible verse using abbreviations and Roman numerals. For example, Lev. xx:13 is the same as Leviticus, chapter 20, verse 13. Locate that chapter within the book. You may be able to find the location of that chapter in the table of contents. If not, you can thumb through the specific book until you see that chapter. As with other books, it should clearly say, “Chapter \\_\\_” at the beginning of each chapter. In addition, many versions clearly say,  : at the top of each page indicating the first verse on that page. Some also note the last verse on the page.\n3. Identify the verse number. The second number after the book name is the verse number. This number should come after a colon (:). In the case of John 3:16, 16 would be the verse number. If you're looking up a longer passage, there may be two numbers, separated by a hyphen (-). For example, in John 3:16-18, you're looking for verses 16,17, and 18.\n4. Locate the verse within the chapter. Once you’ve found the chapter, go through it until you find the verse. The verses go in numerical order, just like chapters. There should be a small number at the beginning of each sentence or a small group of sentences. This is the verse number. If you're looking for multiple verses, such as John 3:16-18, 17 and 18 would follow directly after 16.\n\n\n## Look up a verse with a concordance\n\n1. Choose a concordance. A concordance is a book that lists every instance of a word’s appearance in the Bible. This is a great tool if you remember the verse, or part of the verse, but you don’t know which book or chapter it came from. Concordances can be found through religious retailers or online. Your church may also have one that you can borrow.\n2. Search for a word from the verse. Remember an important word from the verse. Look it up in the concordance the same way that you would look it up in a dictionary. Concordances are alphabetized. Choose a distinctive word that may have limited occurrences, such as “flood,” “mountain,” or “rubies.” If you choose something like “love” or “evil” you’re likely to find an enormous number of results.\n3. Search for other words if necessary. If you find too many results, or you don’t see the verse you’re looking for, try searching for another word. For example, if you remember the phrase, “love must be sincere” and you searched “love” but found too many results, try looking up, “sincere.”\n4. Locate the verse from the concordance list. The concordance will list all of the places where that word is found in the Bible. A complete concordance will give you some context so that you can be sure it’s the verse you’re looking for. Use the location that the concordance gives you (for example, Romans 12:9) to look up the complete verse and its context in your bible.\n5. Try another translation if necessary. Concordances are specific to translations. If you can’t find the verse you’re looking for, try a concordance for a different translation. For example, if your Bible translated a word to the English word “praise,\" but your concordance is for a Bible that translated that word as “worship,” it will be impossible to look up the verse.\n\n\n## Look up a verse online\n\n1. Search the verse number online. Choose a search engine, or go to a website dedicated to Bible study. Type the name of the book and the chapter and verse numbers into the search engine. Type the verse number in the generally accepted format if you can. For example, you'll get more accurate results if you type, \"John 3:16,\" than, \"Chapter 3 16 John.\"\n2. Remember what you can about the verse. Do you remember a certain phrase of the verse? Maybe you remember one or two words and the name of the book it came from. Even if you can’t remember very much, you can likely still look up the verse.\n3. Enter what you know into a search engine. Type in everything you can remember. You should also include the words “Bible” and “verse” to make sure that you get results that are relevant to your search. Your search terms may be something like, “Bible verse about wives in Psalms,” or “Bible verse chapter 7 desert.”\n4. Use a site designed for Bible searches. There are plenty of sites online that catalog Bible verses by subject or by book. You can use one of these websites to search for the verse. Type in a keyword or a subject. You may also be able to do an advanced search by book or chapter. These online tools can be great ways to find other verses that may be relevant to you or helpful in your studies or prayers.\n5. Search related words. If you can’t remember any exact words from the verse, or your search is not going well, search related words. For example, if you searched for “stars” and didn’t find anything, you could search for “night” or “sky” or “heavens” to see if the verse shows up. It’s possible you’re using a different translation or that you misremembered details about the verse.\n"}]}

Both PrPSc and its normal cellular counterpart, PrPC, are encoded by a cellular gene (2, 19). Physical and molecular characterization of PrPSc and PrPC has failed to reveal any chemical differences between the two isoforms (32). However, PrPSc acquires distinctive conformational characteristics upon its conversion from PrPC. Whereas PrPC is soluble in most detergents and can be easily digested by proteases, PrPScis insoluble in detergents and maintains a protease-resistant core, designated PrP27-30, which polymerizes into amyloid (25).\n\nDr. Neena Singh also discovered that prions &quot;piggyback&quot; or attach to another protein called ferritin, as they make their way through the digestive system:\n\nDisease-causing prions are thought to have passed into people when they ate beef from infected cattle, triggering the brain wasting condition called new-variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or vCJD. But researchers have not been sure exactly how prions enter the body.\nTo find out, Neena Singh and her team at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, mimicked the process of eating and digesting infected meat.\nThey mashed up brain tissue that contained prions from patients who had a form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. They then exposed it to a range of harsh digestive enzymes from the mouth, stomach and intestine, which normally break proteins into pieces.\nPrions, which are known to be enormously tough, escape this attack almost unscathed, they showed, as does a second type of protein called ferritin, which stores iron and is abundant in meat. The two proteins seem to stick together, they report in the Journal of Neuroscience.\nThe researchers next added the digested slurry to a lab model of the human gut: a growing sheet of cells from the intestinal lining. By attaching fluorescent tags to the two proteins, they showed that they are transported through the cells hand-in-hand. &quot;Prions probably ride piggyback&quot; through the gut wall into the body, Singh says.\n\nAttaching to ferritin may provide additional protection from digestion, insofar as this removes prions from the digestive system, where proteases are concentrated."}]}
{"dataset": "lima", "id": "lima_671", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How to clean plant leaves?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Clean plants are a beautiful addition to your home and garden, and do a wonderful job of purifying the air. Choose a cleaning method that is safe for your plant, especially if your plant is sensitive to water. Experiment with different shine agents to add a beautiful glow to your plant leaves. Each of these strategies will leave your plants looking clean and shiny.\n\n## Remove dust and grime\n\n1. Wipe large, shiny leaves with a damp cloth. This is the best way to clean large plants, such as rubber plants, that are difficult to move. Dunk your cloth in water and then squeeze out any excess liquid. Gently wipe both sides of all of the leaves to remove any dust and grime. Microfiber cloths or cheesecloths work well for cleaning plants. Clean the leaves each time that you notice dust or dirt building up. This works well for both indoor and outdoor plants such as Gunnera, Plantain Lillies, and Elephant Ears. Place a drop of dishwashing liquid on the cloth if you notice insects eating or landing on your plant.\n2. Use a soft paintbrush to remove dust from plants with fuzzy leaves. Plants with fluffy leaves, such as African Violets, are quite delicate and shouldn’t be wiped. Instead, gently brush any dust or insects off the leaves with a clean, soft paintbrush. If you don’t have a soft paintbrush on-hand, use a pipe cleaner or soft toothbrush instead. Avoid wetting the leaves of fuzzy plants, as this can cause water spots to appear.\n3. Rinse indoor plant leaves with warm water to remove insects and dust. Place your indoor plant in the sink or shower and use the pressure of the water stream to remove any dust and dirt from the plant. The mist from the shower will also help to hydrate the plant’s leaves. Leave the plants to drip-dry and then take them outside to dry in the sunshine. Always use warm water, as cold water can leave spots on the leaves. Don’t wash plants, such as cacti and African Violets, that are sensitive to water. This method works well for Peace Lilies, Sword Ferns, and Devils Ivy.\n4. Dunk small plants into water to quickly get rid of dust. Place your hand over the soil to keep it in place and then turn the plant upside down and submerge the plant in room temperature water. This is a great option for small houseplants and outdoor plants. Allow the plants to drip-dry out of direct light.\n5. Spray compressed air onto cacti to avoid getting them wet. Cacti are used to desert conditions and will often wilt and die if they are over-watered. Spray air from an air compressor can over the spikes to dislodge any dust or dirt from the cacti. Hold the can 10 centimetres (3.9 in) away from the cacti to avoid damaging the spikes. Purchase an air-compressor can from a hardware store or a plant nursery. This works well for both spiky and smooth cacti.\n\n\n## Add shine\n\n1. Rub a thin coat of mayonnaise over the leaves to keep them shiny. Squeeze a little mayonnaise onto a paper towel and wipe it over the leaves. Cover the entire leave with a light enough coat that it cannot be seen. Remove any excess mayonnaise with a clean paper towel. This shiny coating will last for approximately 2 weeks. Simply reapply the mayonnaise to restore the shine of the leaves. This method works for all types of plants.\n2. Cover the leaves in a thin layer of mineral oil for a long-lasting glow. Mineral oil provides a shiny coating for the leaves and helps to prevent dust from accumulating quickly. Simply place a drop of mineral oil onto each leaf and use your fingers to evenly spread it over the top side of the leaf. Use this method on any type of plant. Avoid using coconut or olive oil on the leaves, as this can block the pores of the plant. Keep plants with mineral oil on them out of the direct sun to avoid the leaves from getting burnt. Reapply the mineral oil once or twice per year.\n3. Spray a commercial plant shining product onto the leaves to add sheen. These sprays are specially formulated to keep your plant leaves looking shiny. Liberally spray the product over all the leaves on your plants. If you are spraying outdoor plants, choose a product that is designed for outdoor plants. Purchase a plant shining spray from a plant store. Follow the application instructions on the packet. This is a great option for cacti, as you don’t have to touch the plant.\n"}]}
{"dataset": "lima", "id": "lima_418", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Here are a few paragraphs that I took out of Wikipedia:\n* The Warp Pipe is a common method of transportation used in many of the Mario series games. Warp Pipes are most often green but also appear in other colors (early games included silver pipes, newer games have introduced red, green, blue and yellow pipes), and have many uses in the series. Warp Pipes can also contain enemies, usually Piranha Plants, and sometimes launch the player into the air (most commonly seen in the New Super Mario Bros. series). In early Mario games such as Super Mario Bros., special, well-hidden areas known as Warp Zones contain pipes that allow players to skip several worlds (handfuls of levels) at once.[19] In the New Super Mario Bros. series, pipe-shaped Warp Cannons work similarly to the Warp Zones of the earlier games and are unlocked by finding secret exits in levels. Cannons appear in most of the 3D games in the series starting with Super Mario 64. The character uses the cannon by jumping into the barrel, aiming themself and being fired at a distant target. This allows the character to progress through a level or reach otherwise inaccessible areas.\n* Much of the supporting cast was introduced in the succeeding games for the Genesis and its add-ons. Sonic 2 introduced Sonic's sidekick Miles \"Tails\" Prower, a fox who can fly using his two tails.[208] Sonic CD introduced Amy Rose, a pink hedgehog and Sonic's self-proclaimed girlfriend, and Metal Sonic, a robotic doppelgänger of Sonic created by Eggman.[209] Sonic 3 introduced Sonic's rival Knuckles, a red echidna and the guardian of the Master Emerald.[210] The Master Emerald, introduced in Sonic & Knuckles,[211] controls the power of the Chaos Emeralds.[201] Knuckles' Chaotix introduced the Chaotix, a group comprising Espio the Chameleon, Vector the Crocodile, and Charmy Bee.[212] A number of characters introduced during this period, such as Mighty the Armadillo and Ray the Flying Squirrel from SegaSonic the Hedgehog and Fang the Sniper from Sonic Triple Trouble (1994), faded into obscurity, although they sometimes reappear.[38][213]\n* Some Easter eggs originated from in-jokes between members of the development team. One example is \"Toasty\", which found its way into the game in the form of a small image of sound designer Dan Forden, who would appear in the corner of the screen during gameplay (after performing an uppercut) and yell the phrase \"Toasty!\", originating from him saying \"you're toast\".[45] This egg was also the key to unlocking the hidden character Smoke when it happened in the Portal stage in Mortal Kombat II.[42] In Mortal Kombat 4, Forden would say \"Toasty! 3D!\" after Scorpion did his burn Fatality, a reference to the fact that it is the first 3D game of the series.[46] \"Toasty!\" is also found in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, appearing randomly after the character pulls off a chain of hits, though the picture of Forden was removed for that title,[47] but brought back for the 2011 Mortal Kombat game. Yet another private joke was the hidden character Noob Saibot, who has appeared in various versions of the game starting with Mortal Kombat II. The character's name derived from two of the series' creators' surnames, Ed Boon and John Tobias, spelled backwards.[48] In addition, a counter for ERMACS on the game's audits screen (ERMACS being short for error macros), was interpreted by some players as a reference to a hidden character in the original Mortal Kombat. The development team decided to turn the rumor into reality, introducing Ermac in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 as an unlockable secret character.[49][50] The hidden character Mokap, introduced in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, is a tribute to Carlos Pesina, who played Raiden in MK and MKII and has served as a motion capture actor for subsequent titles in the series.[51]\n\nWrite 10 quiz questions based on the information in these paragraphs."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here are 10 trivia questions based on the three Wikipedia paragraphs you have provided:\n\n1.

{"dataset": "lima", "id": "lima_730", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How to dress nice every day (for girls)?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Dressing nicely each day can take some effort but will ultimately be worth it if your outfits make you feel confident and happy. If you want to look great every day, you will first have to go through your wardrobe and fill it with classic outfit staples. Looking awesome also involves some planning and accessorizing that may take some getting used to but will ultimately result in some stylish outfits.\n\n## Fill your wardrobe\n\n1. Buy classic pieces. To dress nicely, it is important to have some classic pieces in your wardrobe that will never go out of style. Classic pieces are articles of clothing that are generally not too extreme or dated. Instead, they are generally simple and elegant, like a navy blue blazer or a well-crafted black V-neck t-shirt. Though they may sound simple, you can always dress these pieces up with accessories. Basic, classic pieces are generally easier to mix and match, which means that they can be used in a variety of outfits.\n2. Purchase a few accent articles of clothing. To go along with your classic articles of clothing, buy some accent pieces that will make your outfits pop, even if they are simple. These accents could be bright colors that you don’t normally wear or patterns that pop. For example, you could take an outfit that is as simple as a white t-shirt and a navy blue skirt, and make it interesting with a patterned sweater.\n3. Purchase clothes that you can mix and match. When going through your wardrobe, consider whether or not you can use each article of clothing in at least two different outfits. Mixing and matching is an important part of dressing nicely everyday. While you most likely can’t purchase a new outfit for every day of the week, you can buy clothing that you can mix and match to create entirely new and exciting outfits.\n4. Consider your body when picking out your clothes. Certain clothes have cuts that look different on different body types. Look for clothes that flatter your body and make you feel confident. Each person has their idea of what they find flatters their bodies the most, so spend some time trying on different kinds of clothes. For example:\n\t* If you have a ‘Pear’ shape, which means that you have wider hips and a slimmer bust, you could try out an open-neck top, or a dress with an empire waist.\n5. Get rid of clothes that are worn or torn. Part of dressing nicely means giving away or selling old clothes. Clothes get worn out, especially if you wear the same piece a lot, and worn-out clothing does not necessarily look very classy—unless you are going for a look that involves faded clothes and torn jeans. If you find that a shirt has a stain, try your best to get it out, but if the stain remains, it might be time to toss the shirt. Clothes with stains tend to look a little sloppy.\n6. Consider your skin tone when buying your clothes. Picking out clothing that complements your skin tone can make a great outfit that much nicer. Of course, always keep in mind that if you don’t like a color or don’t feel like it looks good on you, don’t wear it. Part of dressing nicely is dressing in things that make you confident and happy; if a certain color matches your skin tone, but you don’t like it anyway, don’t wear it. General guidelines for skin tones and clothing colors include:\n\t* Very light skin tones: Ice tones, pale pinks, greys, baby blues, navies, and grass greens. Medium-light skin tones: Pastel colors, cool reds, and blues. Avoid orange. Medium skin tones: Metallic tones, jewel tones, plums, wine reds, bright blues, deep purples. Medium-dark skin tones: Deep colors like dark greens, bright blues, pale yellows, warm reds. Very dark skin tones: Bright colors like burgundies, cobalt blue, bright orange, and red.\n7. Hang up your clothes and invest in an iron. Another part of dressing nicely is keeping your clothes in tip-top shape. This means hanging up clothes when you can, and ironing folded clothes.

One aspect of dressing nicely is taking the time to plan your outfits. This might mean planning your outfit the night before, or planning an entire week’s worth of outfits at the beginning of the week; go with what works best for you. Trying to figure out a great outfit in the morning before school may make you feel a little too stressed, so take some time to consider your wardrobe and try on several different outfits that you could wear. Some girls find that trying out outfits and taking photos of the ones that they like to put in a binder can help them to decide on an outfit when they are in a rush. If you plan a last-minute outing with your friends, simply flip through the binder and pick out a pre-planned outfit.\n2. Consider the occasion you are dressing for. When planning your outfit, think about what you will be doing in that outfit. Different events call for different kinds of clothing. For instance, if you’re going to school, try not to show too much skin, or wear a shirt that is too low cut. On the other hand, if you’re going to the beach with your friends, wearing a summery dress and shoes you can walk through the sand with maybe the way to go. If you are not sure what would be appropriate to wear to a certain event, such as a cousin's baptism, or a job interview, don’t be afraid to ask friends or family for advice.\n3. Wear clothing that makes you feel confident. When picking out your outfit, make sure that you feel good in your clothes. Ultimately, you should be dressing nicely for yourself rather than dressing for anyone else. It is important to feel comfortable and happy in the clothes that you are wearing; projecting confidence and enthusiasm will give your outfit that extra, energetic boost. Try to keep in mind that if someone only likes you when you are dressed up, that person might not have their priorities straight. First and foremost, dress the way that you want to dress.\n4. Try to avoid combining patterns. While you may be able to get away with some very subtle pattern combinations, it is generally a good idea to only have one pattern in your outfit. Clashing patterns can often make an outfit look sloppy. For instance, if you were wearing an argyle sweater, you would most likely want to avoid wearing that sweater with a striped skirt.\n5. Consider using the rule of three. If you are having trouble putting together an outfit, using the ‘rule of three’ can help you to create a quick but elegant ensemble in no time. When using the rule of three, pick out three colors: two that will be your base colors (most likely your shirt and pants or skirt) and one that will be your accent color. Your base colors could be subtler colors that go together well, such as a navy blue shirt and camel skirt. Your accent color should be a brighter color that makes the rest of your outfit pop, such as a red thin belt or a silver-laced scarf.\n6. Try to wear something extra cute at least once a week. While you may want to look nice every day of the week, throwing on an outfit that dazzles once a week can help to make you feel that much more well-dressed. Take the time to come up with this eye-catching ensemble.\n7. Try to avoid wearing the same outfit twice in a week. While this will not be possible if you have to wear a school uniform, or a uniform for work, try to avoid wearing the same outfit two times a week if you are planning on hanging out or being seen by the same people. If you have two different parties to go to, however, and the people at these parties won’t overlap, feel free to consider wearing the same great outfit. By no means does this mean that you avoid wearing the same article of clothing twice a week. If you have a skirt that works well in two different outfits, feel free to rock both of these ensembles in the same week. Remember, mixing and matching is the key to making you feel like you have an endless wardrobe.\n8. Create an emergency outfit. Some days, you might find that you just don’t want to wear the outfit you have planned. On those days, it's important to have an emergency backup outfit. This outfit should be simple, comfortable, and easy to accessorize with. For example, your emergency outfit could be a pair of nice jeans, a tank top in your favorite color, and a cropped sweater. With these basic items already put together, all you need to go is add a necklace, scarf, or rocking pair of shoes and you’ll be good to go.\n\n\n## Accessorizing\n\n1. Pick out some shoes that will look classy. If you are shopping for shoes, try to pick out a couple of pairs that can be worn with most of your outfits. These could be classic black flats, a nice pair of boots, or short wedges that you can wear with your skirts and dresses. Try on the shoes and make sure you can walk in them easily; if you are planning on wearing them with many of your outfits, it’s important to be able to walk in them.\n2. Wear shoes that would for the occasion. As with your clothes, consider the event you are going to when picking out the shoes you will wear that day. In certain formal events, sandals might not be appropriate, while wearing high heels at school might make it hard to get from class to class on time.\n3. Keep your shoes looking brand new. If your shoes get damaged or scuffed, try to buff the marks out, or use polishes to make your shoes look shiny and new again. Part of looking nice is being dressed well—from your head to your feet. If you are not sure how to clean your shoes, take a look at some of the following articles:\n\t* Shine shoes\n\t* Polish shoes\n\t* Wash shoes\n4. Try out different kinds of jewelry. Accessorizing can help to take your outfit to a whole new level. When creating outfits for yourself, try on different kinds of jewelry and see how they change or affect the outfit you are wearing. Sometimes, adding a statement necklace or chandelier earrings can take your outfit from nice to outstanding. However, try not to over-accessorize. For example, if you are planning on wearing a chunky necklace, try wearing a small pair of stud earrings, rather than a pair of dangling earrings that could make your jewelry feel overbearing.\n5. Consider where you want the focus to be when accessorizing. Jewelry can draw a person’s eye, which can be both a great thing and an unwanted thing. For example, if you want your focus to be on your face, wear large or dangling earrings. If you want the focus to be on the rest of your outfit, consider wearing a longer necklace that ties your whole outfit together. However, if you are wearing a low-cut shirt, try to refrain from wearing a longer necklace, as it might draw too much attention to your chest area.\n6. Try out different kinds of accessories. Accessories are not just limited to jewelry and shoes. You can spice up an outfit by adding an accent scarf, a colorful belt, or a stylish hat. Play around with different kinds of accessories that fit into your style.\n7. Create your own ‘golden rule’. The ‘golden rule’ refers to the maximum number of accessories you will allow yourself. This is completely based on your own opinion. Some people like to layer necklaces and wear funky shoes. Others, prefer a chic minimalist style in which you choose one or two accessories that compliment your outfit. Remember that you can change your golden rule when you feel like it doesn’t reflect your personality anymore. For instance, maybe you like wearing three necklaces and a bunch of bracelets, but during the year your preferences chance and you decide to limit yourself to three accessories; go with what will make you feel happy and confident.\n"}]}

He finds out that the children as well as the adults have been isolated from the rest of the world and speak a dialect called Gullah, with \"Conrack\" of the novel's title being the best they can do to pronounce his last name. The school has only two rooms for all grades combined, with the Principal teaching grades one through four and Conroy teaching the higher grades. Conroy discovers that the students aren't taught much and will have little hope of making a life in the larger world.\nConroy tries to teach them about the outside world but comes into conflict both with the principal and Mr. Skeffington, the superintendent. He teaches them how to brush their teeth, who Babe Ruth is, and has the children listen to music, including Flight of the Bumblebee and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. He explains that the when Beethoven wrote the Fifth Symphony, he was writing about \"what death would sound like.\"  He is also astounded they've never even heard of Halloween, and he decides to take them to Beaufort on the mainland to go trick-or-treating, which the superintendent has forbidden. He also must overcome parental fears of \"the river\". As a result, he's fired.  As he leaves the island for the last time, the children come out to see him leave, all of them lined up on a rickety bridge.

"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Faulty Premise #1: John the Baptist was a reincarnation of Elijah\n\nWhen Jesus asked Peter who people said he was, he answered that some people thought that Jesus was Elijah come back. Peter knew better and said Jesus was the Christ. In any event, John the Baptist himself directly denied the claim (see John 1:19-21). \nWhat Jesus more likely was saying in Matthew 11 is that John the Baptist was a prophet in the tradition of Elijah. Elijah was the greatest of the prophets (even if his disciple Elisha inherited a double portion of his spirit). All of the prophets that followed came in the name and spirit of Elijah, in the same way that some of Paul's letters apparently were created after his death. They were in the spirit and tradition even if not the actual man. \nNote also Elijah never died - he was taken up into heaven, and people thought he would return. As such, no Elijah was not being thought to have reincarnated- only returned. Elijah's return was long a part of Jewish custom. Even today, during a Passover sedar, a chair is left empty for Elijah. But again, since he did not die, Jews look for his return, not his reincarnation. \n\nFaulty Premise #2: The Jewish world view has  any concept of reincarnation at all\n\nThe most basic rule of hermeneutics suggests that a text cannot mean what it could not mean to the original audience. If the Jews had no concept of reincarnation, then any interpretation that says it does has a very, very high bar to clear.\nIn his book The Gift of the Jews, Thomas Cahill advances the thesis that the primary distinctive philosophy of the Jews was precisely that history was not circular. Their linear idea of a human life was a departure from others and was an explicit rejection of reincarnation. As such, a text would need to be exceedingly explicit to a culture that rejected circular life patterns, and the obscure interpretation above (especially in light of the more obvious intepretation) simply doesn't hold water.\nFurthermore, the book of Hebrews - written to the people into which both Jesus and John the Baptist were born - explicitly reject reincarnation. As the writer points out in 9:27, \n\n  It is appointed unto a man once to die and then the judgement.\n\nHere we do have an explicit rejection of reincarnation by the followers of Jesus. There is one death. There is one judgement. Hence, in any Christian worldview, you don't come back."}]}

These are the Kronecker delta $\\delta_{ij}$ and the Levi-Civita symbol $\\epsilon_{ijk \\cdots}$. Contracting two vectors with these symbols yields the dot and cross products, respectively (the latter only works in three dimensions).

A KTN is a number that's issued by either the US Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or Department of Defense (DoD). This number indicates that the person who has it has undergone a pre-flight background check before checking in for their flight and is eligible for an expedited customs experience. To get a KTN, apply for TSA Precheck, Global Entry, NEXUS, or SENTRI.\n\n## Get a ktn through tsa precheck\n\n1. Go for TSA Precheck if you only travel within the United States. If you're a lawful U.S. citizen or permanent resident and you just travel within the United States, this may be the program for you. Get your KTN through TSA Precheck so that you don't have to bother with getting a passport.\n2. Pre-enroll for TSA Precheck online. In order to start the application process, visit https://universalenroll.dhs.gov. Here, you'll disclose basic biographical information, such as your name, birthdate, and address.\n3. Make an appointment at an application center. After you finish filling out the brief form, you'll be prompted to make an appointment for your interview. For TSA Precheck, you can choose from over 300 locations within the United States. Find a location near you by going to https://universalenroll.dhs.gov/locator.\n4. Go to your in-person interview. Before you head to your scheduled interview, make sure that you have a valid photo ID, a valid proof of citizenship, and immigration documentation if applicable. The interview should only take about 15 minutes, and you'll be asked questions about yourself and your travel habits, and you'll also be fingerprinted during this time. Your driver's license can serve as a valid photo ID. Your passport or birth certificate can serve as a valid proof of citizenship.\n5. Pay the $85 application fee. At the interview, you'll need to pay your nonrefundable application fee, which will cover the cost of having a background check done. You can pay with a credit card, money order, company check, or cashier's check.\n6. Check your application status online. After your interview, check the status of your application by going to https://universalenroll.dhs.gov/workflows?workflow=service-status&servicecode=11115V. You'll likely receive a notification letter within 1-2 days of your interview, but it can sometimes take up to 45 days. If you're approved, your notification letter will include your 9-digit KTN.\n7. Add your KTN to each reservation. Every time you book a flight, type in your KTN number wherever it's asked for. This way, you'll be recognized as a known traveler, which means you won't have to take off your shoes, belt, or jacket, or take out your laptop or liquids. If you book through a travel agent, be sure to give the travel agent you KTN. Contact your airline via phone or online to add your KTN to your reservation after you've already booked it.\n\n\n## Apply for global entry\n\n1. Choose Global Entry if you travel internationally. While TSA Precheck allows you to to enjoy a faster customs experience while traveling within the United States, Global Entry allows you to breeze through customs while traveling within the United States and also internationally. Get your KTN through Global Entry if you're a lawful U.S. citizen or permanent resident and you travel outside the country. You can also apply for Global Entry if you are a citizen of India, citizen of Colombia, citizen of the United Kingdom, citizen of Germany, citizen of Panama, citizen of Singapore, citizen of South Korea, citizen of Switzerland, or a Mexican National.\n2. Create a GOES account and apply for Global Entry. Navigate to https://ttp.cbp.dhs.gov. Click “Get Started” to create an account. Then, log into your account. You'll have several different programs to choose from, so make sure you click on “Global Entry” and then fill out the application. This should take about half an hour and will require information such as your passport information, your residence history, and your employment history.\n3. Pay the $100 application fee online. At the end of the Global Entry application, you will be prompted to fill in your credit card or bank account information in order to pay for the application fee. The fee is $100 and is valid for 5 years. Some credit cards, specifically the ones designed for frequent fliers and corporate travelers, may reimburse you for this fee.\n4. Wait to receive an email. Once you've applied and paid the fee, check your inbox for an email. You can expect this email to come within a week or so of submitting the application. The email will prompt you to log in to your GOES account, which will notify you that you're approved, pending your interview, if everything on your application checked out. If you don't receive an email, try calling the Global Entry customer service phone line at 866-530-4172.\n5. Schedule an interview at an enrollment center. While logged into your GOES account, you'll be prompted to pick an interview day, time, and location. Here, you can look up the enrollment centers that are closest to where you are. If you live in or near a major city, look into a few different locations, as some may be able to take you the next day but others may have a month-long wait.\n6. Go to your scheduled interview. The interview questions are typically simple and straightforward. You can expect to be asked about basic topics such as your traveling tendencies and your employment status. If you're approved, your fingerprints will be taken and you'll get your KTN at the end of the interview.\n7. Scan your passport at an airport kiosk to use your KTN. Bring your passport to the airport every time you fly, and scan your passport at a Global Entry kiosk. Then, the kiosk will take your photo, scan your fingerprints, and print out your receipt, which you'll hand to the customs agent. This will get you access to an expedited customs experience.\n\n\n## Become a member of nexus\n\n1. Apply for NEXUS if you travel to Canada often. NEXUS is similar to Global Entry, but it only allows you to move through customs quicker when you're traveling domestically within the U.S. or you're crossing the border of the United States and Canada. Choose this program if you're a lawful Canadian citizen/permanent resident or a lawful U.S. citizen/permanent resident who needs to frequently cross the border. You can go to Canada without a passport if you're a U.S. citizen and you become a member of NEXUS.\n2. Create a GOES account. Get online and navigate to ttp.cbp.dhs.gov. Click on “Register in English” and fill out the prompted information to create a GOES account. When you're done, you'll receive an identification number and be a registered GOES user.\n3. Complete the NEXUS application online. Through your GOES account, download the NEXUS application online. Complete it, and provide copies of all of the government documents that the application requires, including your proof of citizenship or permanent residence, a valid passport, and proof of your current residence. Submit the application when you're finished with it.\n4. Pay the $50 fee online. The processing fee for applying to become a member of NEXUS is $50, which is the most affordable of all of the program fees. Pay this online with a credit card through your GOES account.\n5. Schedule an interview through your GOES account. Once your application has been processed, you'll get a notification through your GOES account that you need to schedule an interview at an enrollment center. There are only a few locations where you can do this, and all of them can be found at http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/prog/nexus/location-eng.html.\n6. Gather required documents and forms of ID for your NEXUS interview. You'll need to bring a valid driver's license, proof of residency, your NEXUS conditional approval letter, and any documents that you used on your application to prove you're a U.S. citizen, U.S. permanent resident, Canadian citizen, or Canadian permanent resident. Bring your vehicle's title and registration if you plan to drive across the border. Bring your proof of custody if you plan to take a child under the age of 18 across the border.\n7. Go to your NEXUS interview. Attend your scheduled interview at the location you chose. Your interview should take about 30 minutes, and you'll be asked questions by both a U.S. customs officer and a Canadian customs officer during this time. If the interview goes well and you're approved for membership, you'll also be fingerprinted. During the interview, you might be asked questions like, “Why do you want a NEXUS card?” or “Do you still live at this address?”\n8. Scan your passport at Global Entry kiosks when you travel. As a NEXUS member, you can use your KTN the same way that Global Entry members use it. When you travel, find a Global Entry kiosk, scan your passport, and proceed as the kiosk guides you to. Just like with Global Entry members, you can give the receipt that ‘s printed at this kiosk to the customs agent in order to have an expedited customs experience.\n9. Add your PASSID to your reservations and frequent flier profiles. When you become a NEXUS member, you'll be issued a PASSID, which is exactly the same as a KTN. If you'd rather check in before heading to the airport, be sure to include your PASSID in the appropriate field when you fill out your flight registration information.\n\n\n## Acquire your ktn through sentri\n\n1. Choose SENTRI if you travel to Mexico often. The benefits of being a SENTRI member are specific to crossing the U.S. and Mexican border. Go with this program to get your KTN if you're a lawful U.S. citizen who travels to Mexico on a regular basis.\n2. Create a GOES account online. SENTRI is another program that requires you to have a GOES account. Register by clicking “Get Started,” and filling out all of the prompted information on https://ttp.cbp.dhs.gov.\n3. Complete an online application. After you've gotten a GOES account, you can log in and find the application for SENTRI. Fill it out entirely and include copies of any documents that the application requires of you. You'll likely need to supply copies of your passport and your proof of citizenship or proof of permanent residence.\n4. Pay the SENTRI fee of $122.25. This fee covers the application fee, the fingerprint fee, as well as the system cost fee. After you finish filling out the application, you'll have an opportunity to pay this nonrefundable fee. Make the payment with a credit card, certified check, money order, or through electronic bank transfer.\n5. Schedule to your SENTRI interview at an enrollment center. Once your application is conditionally approved, you'll be instructed through your GOES account to make an appointment for your interview. There are many different locations that you can choose from, all of which are considered “enrollment centers.”\n6. Go to your scheduled interview with the required documents. Bring the required documents with you and answer the interviewer's questions truthfully. You'll then be approved and fingerprinted if the interview goes well.\n7. Scan your passport at a Global Entry kiosk. To reap the benefits of your SENTRI membership, head to the Global Entry kiosk and scan your passport before you go to customs. The kiosk will prompt you to answer a couple of questions and it will take your photo and scan your fingerprints. It will then print out a receipt that you can give to the customs agent so that you can move quickly through.\n8. Include your PASSID in your flight reservations. If you'd rather not worry about dealing with the kiosk before your flight, you can simply include your PASSID (KTN) on your reservation when you book your flight. That way, your precheck privileges will be noted on your boarding pass and you can skip the kiosk altogether.\n"}]}

A green card is not one of the accepted documents after an absence of more than 1 year, and she doesn't have any of the other documents, like a Re-entry Permit or an immigrant visa.\n\nHowever, under 8 CFR 211.1(b)(3) and 8 CFR 211.4, the immigration officers at the port of entry have the authority to waive her failure to meet the documentary requirements, if they determine that she has not abandoned residence. They often will grant the waiver if it's the first time, the absence is not too much over a year, and/or there is a good reason for not returning earlier (e.g. COVID-19). So if she manages to make it to a US port of entry, there is a good chance they will just let her in, perhaps with a warning.\n\nThe officer could deny her entry, and pressure her to voluntarily sign I-407 to relinquish her permanent residency. This is voluntary, and she can refuse. If she refuses, they will give her a Notice to Appear for removal proceedings in immigration court at a later date. There, she will be able to present her case to the immigration judge, and if the immigration judge determines that she has not abandoned residence, the immigration judge can grant the waiver for her failure to meet the documentary requirements (think of it as a second opinion on the immigration officer's decision).\n\nThe other option to all this is that she can apply for an SB1 returning resident visa at a US consulate (which will meet the documentary requirements since it is an immigrant visa). However, this requires showing that she could not return any earlier due to circumstances beyond her control (which may be harder to prove than showing that she did not abandon residence). Also, there is no appeal for visa denials."}]}

This won't affect the maximum speed of your connection, but it would cause some latency. pjc50 points out that it's about a nanosecond for every foot of cable length, which is a good rule of thumb used by many engineers when developing systems which are very dependent on latencies on those timescales.\n\nIn reality, you will never notice a difference. A \"fast\" ping time on the Internet is 10&nbsp;ms, which is 10,000,000&nbsp;ns. Adding even a few hundred feet of cable isn't going to have a noticeable effect at that point. In fact, nearly every step of the way involves delays which are more extreme than those seen from signal propagation. For example, most consumer grade routers will wait for the last byte of an incoming packet to be received and check it for errors before sending the first byte of the packet on its way. This delay will be on the order of 5,000&nbsp;ns! Given that the maximum length of cable you can run (per the Ethernet spec) is 300&nbsp;ft, the cable length could never cause more than 300&nbsp;ns of delay due to the cable!"}]}

What methods are available to deal with NPC problems? Is there a survey or something similar on this topic?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are a number of well-studied strategies; which is best in your application depends on circumstance.\n\n* Improve worst case runtime\nUsing problem-specific insight, you can often improve the naive algorithm. For instance, there are $O(c^n)$ algorithms for Vertex Cover with $c huge improvement over the naive $\\Omega(2^n)$ and might make instance sizes relevant for you tractable.\n\n* Improve expected runtime\nUsing heuristics, you can often devise algorithms that are fast on many instances. If those include most that you meet in practice, you are golden. Examples are SAT for which quite involved solvers exist, and the Simplex algorithm (which solves a polynomial problem, but still). One basic technique that is often helpful is branch and bound.\n\n* Restrict the problem\nIf you can make more assumptions on your inputs, the problem may become easy.\n\n* Structural properties\nYour inputs may have properties that simplify solving the problem, e.g. planarity, bipartiteness or missing a minor for graphs. See here for some examples of graph classes for which CLIQUE is easy.  \n\n* Bounding functions of the input\nAnother thing to look at is parameterised complexity; some problems are solvable in time $O(2^kn^m)$ for $k$ some instance parameter (maximum node degree, maximum edge weight, ...) and $m$ constant. If you can bound $k$ by a polylogarithmic function in $n$ in your setting, you get polynomial algorithms. Saeed Amiri gives details in his answer.\n\n* Bounding input quantities\nFurthermore, some problems admit algorithms that run in pseudo-polynomial time, that is their runtime is bounded by a polynomial function in a number that is part of the input; the naive primality check is an example. This means that if the quantities encoded in your instances have reasonable size, you might have simple algorithms that behave well for you.\n\n* Weaken the result\nThis means that you tolerate errorneous or incomplete results. There are two main flavors:\n\n* Probabilistic algorithms\nYou only get the correct result with some probability. There are some variants, most notable Monte-Carlo and Las-Vegas algorithms. A famous example is the Miller-Rabin primality test.\n\n* Approximation algorithms\nYou no longer look for optimal solutions but almost optimal ones. Some algorithms admit relative (\"no worse than double the optimum\"), others absolute (\"no worse than $5$ plus the optimum\") bounds on the error. For many problems it is open how well they can be approximated. There are some that can be approximated arbitrarily well in polynomial time, while others are known to not allow that; check the theory of polynomial-time approximation schemes.\n\nRefer to Algorithmics for Hard Problems by Hromkovič for a thorough treatment.\n* Simplicity is beauty: Improved upper bounds for vertex cover by Chen Jianer, Iyad A.

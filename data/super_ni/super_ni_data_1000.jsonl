Most citizens of Bulgaria have associations — at least nominally — with the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. Founded in 870 AD under the Patriarchate of Constantinople , the Bulgarian Orthodox Church had autocephalous status since 927 AD. The Church became subordinate within the Patriarchate of Constantinople, twice during the periods of Byzantine  and Ottoman  domination. It was re-established first in 1870 in the form of the Bulgarian Exarchate, and then in the 1950s as the Bulgarian Patriarchate. \nQuestion: How many in percent in Bulgaria from the census weren't atheist? \nAnswer type: Number\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "100."}]}

Your task is to generate question for given answer based on set of context paragraphs, supporting facts and an answer.\nContext_1 : The Battle of Fort Charlotte or the Siege of Fort Charlotte was a two-week siege conducted by Spanish General Bernardo de Gálvez against the British fortifications guarding the port of Mobile (which was then in the British province of West Florida, and now in Alabama) during the Anglo-Spanish War of 1779-1783. Fort Charlotte was the last remaining British frontier post capable of threatening New Orleans in Spanish Louisiana. Its fall drove the British from the western reaches of West Florida and reduced the British military presence in West Florida to its capital, Pensacola. Context_2 : The Gulf Coast campaign or the Spanish conquest of West Florida in the Anglo-Spanish War, was a series of military operations primarily directed by the governor of Spanish Louisiana, Bernardo de Gálvez against the British province of West Florida. Begun with operations against British positions on the Mississippi River shortly after Britain and Spain went to war in 1779, Gálvez completed the conquest of West Florida in 1781 with the successful siege of Pensacola. Context_3 : Gálveztown was the HMS \"West Florida\", which the Continental Navy schooner USS \"Morris\" captured at the Battle of Lake Pontchartrain, which was then in the British province of West Florida. \"West Florida\" became the Gálveztown, supposedly under the command of Bernardo de Gálvez, the Spanish governor of Louisiana (New Spain). Context_4 : The 2016 West Florida Argonauts football team represented the University of West Florida in the 2016 NCAA Division II football season. They were led by head coach Pete Shinnick, who was in his first season at West Florida for the team's inaugural season. The Argonauts played their home games at Blue Wahoos Stadium and were members of the Gulf South Conference. They finished the season with a record of 5 wins and 6 losses (5–6 overall, 3–5 in the GSC), defeating one top 25 ranked team and were not invited in the 2016 playoffs. Context_5 : The Florida Panhandle, Northwest Florida, or West Florida, an informal, unofficial term for the northwestern part of the U.S. state of Florida, is a strip of land roughly 200 miles long and 50 to 100 miles wide (320 km by 80 to 160 km), lying between Alabama on the north and the west, Georgia also on the north, and the Gulf of Mexico to the south. Its eastern boundary is arbitrarily defined. The terms West Florida and Northwest Florida are today generally synonymous with the Panhandle, although historically West Florida was the name of a British colony (1763–1783), later a Spanish colony (1783–1821), both of which included modern-day Florida west of the Apalachicola River as well as portions of what are now Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Context_6 : FH Joanneum is one of the largest Universities of Applied Sciences in Austria. It has about 4,000 students and about 578 employees. The main campus is located in Graz, while there are two other locations in Kapfenberg and Bad Gleichenberg. All three are situated in the province of Styria, Austria. Context_7 : Andreas Wolfsgruber (born 1962, Salzburg, Austria) is an Austrian car designer and, since 2000, Head of the Magna Steyr Design Department. Between 1997 - 2000 he was engaged as a Lecturer at the Fh Joanneum Graz – Degree Programme „Industrial Management“. Context_8 : The Floridas was a region of the southeastern United States comprising the historical colonies of East Florida and West Florida. The borders of East and West Florida varied. In 1783, when Spain acquired West Florida and re-acquired East Florida from Great Britain through the Peace of Paris (1783), the eastern British boundary of West Florida was the Apalachicola River, but Spain in 1785 moved it eastward to the Suwannee River. The purpose was to transfer San Marcos and the district of Apalachee from East Florida to West Florida. From 1810 to 1813, the United States extended piecemeal control over the part of West Florida that comprised the modern-day Gulf coasts of Alabama and Mississippi and the Florida Parishes of Louisiana. After the ratification of the Adams-Onis Treaty in 1821 the United States combined East Florida and what had been the remaining Spanish-controlled rump of West Florida into the territory that comprised modern-day Florida. Context_9 : The academic regalia of Stanford University describes the robes, gowns, and hoods which are prescribed by the university for its graduates. Stanford University was founded in 1891 and academic dress has been a part of academic life at the school since at least 1899. As in most American universities, the academic dress found at Stanford is derived from that of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, which was a development of academic and clerical dress common throughout the medieval universities of Europe. Today, also in common with most American universities, academic regalia is commonly seen only at graduation ceremonies. For most of its academic dress, Stanford follows the Intercollegiate Code of Academic Costume which was devised in 1895 and sets out a detailed uniform scheme of academic regalia. Stanford does make use of a distinct robe for its PhD graduates which was unique among American institutions of higher education in being based specifically on the doctoral robes of the University of Cambridge (until 2005, when Vanderbilt University adopted a similar design). Context_10 : The University of West Florida, also known as West Florida and UWF, is a mid-sized public university located in Pensacola, Florida, United States. Established in 1963 as a member institution of the State University System of Florida, the University of West Florida is a comprehensive research university without faculties of law or medicine, a designated space-grant institution, and sits on the third largest campus in the State University System, at 1600 acre . The main campus is a natural preserve that is bordered by two rivers and Escambia Bay. The university's mascot is an Argonaut and its logo is the Chambered Nautilus. fact_1 : The University of West Florida, also known as West Florida and UWF, is a mid-sized public university located in Pensacola, Florida, United States. fact_2 : FH Joanneum is one of the largest Universities of Applied Sciences in Austria.

And, according to the Democrat in North Carolina’s U.S. Senate race, the Republican incumbent thinks struggling communities should go bankrupt. That’s what Cal Cunningham said about Sen. Thom Tillis. \"\"Mitch McConnell said he wanted states to go bankrupt instead of the federal government providing relief. Today, Thom Tillis agreed,\"\" Cunningham tweeted April 24, linking to a Politico story. Is that true? There’s a lot of context being left out. Yes, Tillis did say he is \"\"more or less aligned\"\" with what McConnell, the U.S. Senate majority leader, said about not giving more federal dollars to states that had pre-existing budget problems. McConnell proposed allowing them to file for bankruptcy, which states are not currently permitted to do. But Cunningham exaggerated what we know about Tillis’ position. Tillis’ comments clearly show he doesn’t want the federal government to pay for state debt that wasn’t incurred during the coronavirus outbreak. What’s less clear is whether he wants those states to go the bankruptcy route. So what did McConnell say about bankruptcy? In a radio interview on April 22, McConnell said states with pre-existing problems might be better off declaring bankruptcy than by expecting additional funding from the federal government. But he didn’t specifically say he \"\"wanted\"\" states to declare bankruptcy, only that he supports it as an option. \"\"I would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route. It saves some cities. And there’s no good reason for it not to be available,\"\" McConnell said. \"\"My guess is their first choice would be for the federal government to borrow money from future generations to send it down to them now so they don’t have to do that. That’s not something I’m going to be in favor of.\"\" As The Atlantic reported, McConnell expanded on his bankruptcy comments in another radio interview that day: \"\"We’re not interested in solving their pension problems for them. We’re not interested in rescuing them from bad decisions they've made in the past, we’re not going to let them take advantage of this pandemic to solve a lot of problems that they created themselves (with) bad decisions in the past.\"\" That brings us to Tillis and how closely he has \"\"agreed\"\" with McConnell. Audio of the April 24 town hall shows a constituent named Charles saying he has a question about the future: \"\"Will the Senate vote to bail out poorly-run states that were near bankrupt before COVID-19 hit?\"\" Tillis wasn’t asked about states in general. He was asked specifically about \"\"poorly-run states that were near bankrupt\"\" prior to the pandemic. Tillis said he doesn’t think those states should be bailed out. \"\"Well, Charles, that's a great question and personally I don't think we should, and I don't think that we can,\"\" Tillis said. He then said the $2 trillion economic stimulus gave him \"\"pause,\"\" but was worth it. Then he used North Carolina’s state government as an example of good financial stewardship: \"\"I'm not so sure that taxpayer dollars for North Carolina should go to a state, a county, or a city that, like you said, was in poor economic shape before we ever had the virus. We need to take care of first responders. We need to take care of law enforcement. And we will do that. But I don't believe that I can support any measure that is effectively a bailout for poorly run state and local governments. \"\"We can look at things on a case-by-case basis where it's very clear that the damage is done because of the virus impact. But a broad-based bailout is not something I'd be prepared to support.\"\" That’s when Tillis brought up McConnell’s comments. \"\"You probably heard Leader McConnell's comments about it, I'm more or less aligned with Leader McConnell on the issue,\"\" Tillis said, a few seconds later adding: \"\"I think we need to work on executing (plans already signed into law) and not really entertain a discussion of trillions more going into jurisdictions that really need to get their financial houses in order.\"\" Cunningham spokeswoman Rachel Petri said Tillis’s comments about McConnell show he’s in lockstep with the Senate leader, who said \"\"I would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route.\"\" Tillis elaborated on his position in an interview with Fox News radio's Guy Benson on April 29. Benson asked him about McConnell’s comments that money should not cover pre-pandemic budget holes (without mentioning the bankruptcy idea). Tillis said the Senate \"\"will go back and take a look at well-documented cases for the costs of the response, potentially the cause of some of the revenues in this year based on closures.\"\" When PolitiFact asked about Tillis’ position on the bankruptcy option, Tillis campaign spokesman Andrew Romeo said: \"\"Sen. Tillis has never advocated for any state or municipality to go bankrupt as a result of COVID-19, has already delivered billions of dollars in relief to North Carolina, and has consistently said that he supports providing targeted assistance for communities that have been impacted by the virus.\"\" Cunningham tweeted, \"\"Mitch McConnell said he wanted states to go bankrupt instead of the federal government providing relief. Today, Thom Tillis agreed.\"\" The tweet lacks so much context that it’s several degrees removed from what’s actually been said. McConnell wasn’t talking about just any states, he was talking about states that were in poor financial shape before the coronavirus outbreak. Additionally, McConnell said he supported bankruptcy as a novel option for states, particularly for those with pre-existing pension liabilities. Tillis said he agreed with McConnell \"\"more or less.\"\" He agreed that Congress shouldn’t pay for revenue losses that aren’t related to the coronavirus outbreak. But Tillis never actually said he wanted states to go bankrupt. And he said he will consider federal aid for smaller governments on a case-by-case basis. Cunningham’s tweet exaggerates what McConnell said and misrepresents what Tilils has said about federal coronavirus aid. It contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\" Claim: Mitch McConnell said he wanted states to go bankrupt instead of the federal government providing relief. Today, Thom Tillis agreed.\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

The \"heat\" is another thing entirely, because heat is defined as the average kinetic energy of particles, and photons don't count strictly in that definition.\\n\\nThere are particles that come from the sun in the form of solar wind, and around the region of the Earth, they have a \"temperature\" around 1000k.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "what is the temperature on the sun and how to calculate the lost of heat per distance from it?"}]}

Frank Darby, que afirmava haver estat un treballador al zoo, suggerí que Benjamin havia estat el nom afectiu donat a l'animal en un article de diari del maig del 1968. Tanmateix, no existeix cap document que indiqui que tenia un nom afectiu i Alison Reid (la cuidadora de facto del zoo en aquells temps) i Michael Sharland (publicista del zoo) negaren que Frank Darby hagués treballat al zoo o que l'animal hagués estat anomenat Benjamin. Darby també sembla l'origen de l'afirmació que l'últim llop marsupial era un mascle: les proves fotogràfiques suggereixen que era una femella.[45] Aquest exemplar morí el 7 de setembre del 1936. Es creu que morí per negligència. Tancat a fora del seu refugi, quedà exposat a un fenomen meteorològic rar a Tasmània: una calor sufocant durant el dia i temperatures glacials a la nit.[46] Aquest llop marsupial apareix a l'última gravació coneguda d'un exemplar vivent: 62 segons en blanc i negre que el mostren movent-se amunt i avall pel seu recinte, filmats pel naturalista David Fleay el 1933.[47] A Austràlia, cada 7 de setembre, des de l'any 1996, se celebra el National Threatened Species Day (Dia nacional de les espècies amenaçades) per tal de commemorar la mort de l'últim llop marsupial registrat oficialment.[48]\nQuestion: Quants anys visqué Benjamin al zoològic de Hobart?\n\n### Response:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "tres"}]}

You need to provide the correct answer for it. Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred.\n\nNow complete the following instance -\nInput: The commercial spacecraft Nostromo is on a return trip to Earth with a seven-member crew in stasis: Captain Dallas, Executive Officer Kane, Navigator Lambert, Science Officer Ash, Warrant Officer Ripley, and Engineers Parker and Brett. Detecting a mysterious transmission, possibly a distress signal, from a nearby planetoid, the ship's computer, Mother, awakens the crew. Following standard company policy for such situations, the Nostromo lands on the planetoid and Dallas, Kane, and Lambert head out to investigate, damaging their ship upon landing in dust. They discover the signal is coming from a derelict alien spacecraft. Inside, they find the remains of a large alien creature whose ribcage appears to have exploded from the inside.On the Nostromo, Ripley determines that the transmission is not a distress signal but a warning. In the alien ship, Kane discovers a chamber containing hundreds of eggs. As he inspects one, a creature springs out, spits acid through his space helmet and attaches itself to his face. Dallas and Lambert carry the unconscious Kane back to the Nostromo. As acting senior officer, Ripley refuses to let them aboard, citing quarantine regulations, but Ash violates protocol by overriding Ripley's lock and letting them in. The crew are unable to remove the creature from Kane's face, as its grip is strong and its blood is an extremely corrosive acid. It eventually lets go, crawls away, and dies.The crew repair the ship and lift off. Kane awakens and seems healthy, but during the crew's final meal before re-entering stasis, he chokes and convulses in pain before a small alien creature bursts from his chest, killing him, and escapes into the depths of the ship to molt. Since attacking the creature with conventional weapons could result in its corrosive blood breaching the ship's hull, the crew attempts to locate and capture it with motion trackers, nets, electric prods, and flamethrowers.Brett is sent to look for the crew's cat, Jones, and the now fully grown alien attacks him and disappears with his body into the air shafts. After a heated discussion, the group devises a plan to jettison the creature out of the ship. Dallas enters the Nostromo's labyrinthine ventilation shafts, intending to force the alien into an airlock, but it ambushes him. Lambert, realizing the alien is killing the crew one by one, implores the others to escape in the ship's shuttle. Now in command, Ripley explains that the shuttle will not support four people, and recommends that they continue with Dallas' plan of flushing the alien out.Accessing Mother, Ripley discovers that Ash has secretly been ordered to return the alien to the crew's employers, who consider the crew expendable. When Ripley confronts Ash, he tries to choke her to death. Parker intervenes and knocks off Ash's head, revealing him to be an android. Parker reanimates Ash's head, and Ripley interrogates him. They learn he was assigned to the Nostromo to convince the crew to capture the creature and return it for analysis, even at the expense of the human personnel. Ash taunts them about their chances of survival against the \"perfect organism.\" Parker turns a flamethrower on Ash.Ripley, Lambert and Parker agree to set the Nostromo to self-destruct and escape in the shuttle. However, Parker and Lambert are ambushed and killed by the alien while gathering life-support supplies. Ripley initiates the self-destruct sequence and heads for the shuttle with Jones, but the alien blocks her path. She retreats and unsuccessfully attempts to abort the self-destruct sequence, then returns to retrieve Jones, finding the alien gone. She narrowly escapes in the shuttle as the Nostromo explodes.As she prepares to enter stasis, Ripley discovers the Alien is aboard the shuttle. She dons a spacesuit and opens the shuttle's airlock, causing explosive decompression which forces the Alien into the shuttle's open doorway. She propels it into space by shooting it with a grappling hook, but the gun catches in the closing door, tethering the alien to the shuttle. Ripley activates the engines, blasting the alien into space. After recording the ship's final log entry, she places herself and Jones into stasis for the voyage home., Question: What did Kane discover in the Alien ship?\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: a chamber containing hundreds of eggs."}]}

Your answer can not consist of any word that is not mentioned in any of these: the background paragraph, the story, or the question. You can directly copy and paste a span from the story or the question while answering the given question.\n\nInput:\nBackground Paragraph: A rise in price of a good or service almost always decreases the quantity demanded of that good or service. Conversely, a fall in price will increase the quantity demanded. When the price of a gallon of gasoline increases, for example, people look for ways to reduce their consumption by combining several errands, commuting by carpool or mass transit, or taking weekend or vacation trips closer to home. Economists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded the law of demand. The law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand (which we explain in the next module) are held constant. \nStory: The AAA auto club does a weekly report on the prices of gas and diesel in various cities. Historically, the prices have be fairly stagnant, but this week their report garnered widespread attention as the prices of gas and diesel plunged from last week in Seattle by $0.40 each. However, just across the border in Vancouver, the cost of gas went up dramatically by $0.50. \nQuestion: Which city will have an increase in demand for gas?\nOutput:\nSeattle.\n\nInput:\nBackground Paragraph: Alpine lakes are classified as lakes or reservoirs at high altitudes, usually starting around 5,000 feet (1524 metres) in elevation above sea level[1] or above the tree line.[2] Alpine lakes are usually clearer than lakes at lower elevations due to the colder water which decreases the speed and amount of algae and moss growth in the water. Often these lakes are surrounded by varieties of pine trees, aspens, and other high altitude trees. \nStory: Michael is planning a retreat for the team members at his company and also a weekend trip with his family. After discussion with his coworkers, he decided that they were going to plan a trip to the outdoors. Lake Schmitz is high up in elevation and Lake Smith is much lower in elevation. His coworkers like to go to places with a lot of trees to relax in the shade and his family likes to go swimming in clear lakes. \nQuestion: Which lake will be less clear?\nOutput:\nLake Smith.\n\nInput:\nBackground Paragraph: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. \nStory: Two brothers went to the doctor's office for an appointment. The doctor discovered that Tim had very high levels of cholesterol, while Jim had normal levels. \nQuestion: Which brother had more cholesterol deposited on the interior of the arterial wall?\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Tim."}]}

This furrow narrows the cell across the centre and eventually p … inches it into two new cells. In plant cells a cleavage furrow does not form. Instead a cell plate forms across the equator of the cell. The main difference between cytokinesis in animal cells and  cytokinesis in plant cells is how the division occurs. In animal  cells there is a formation of a cleavage furro … w which gradually  squeezes the cell in half. In plants cells they form a cell plate  that gradually divides the cell in half. However, in all other cells, irrespective of whether they are plant cells or animal cells, cytokinesis is the method by which the cell divides into two. Advertisement Share This Plant vs Animal Cytokinesis Cell cycle involves events that occur from one cell division to the next cell division. This mainly involves in cell growth and cell division. In animal cells, division involves myosin and a contractile ring made of actin filaments. During cytokinesis, the role of the string is played by the contractile ring. Now, the contractile ring is composed of actin filaments that are assembled just below the cell membrane. Mitosis is followed by cytokinesis, the splitting of the cytoplasm . In cell division, a parent cell splits, producing two daughter cells that are identical to the parent. Eukaryotic unicellular organisms like the protist Amoeba use cell division in the production of new individuals, propagating their species. The cleavage furrow that divides an animal cell is also called a contractile ring. It is believed that the course taken by the narrowing contractile ring during cytokinesis is determined by the microtubules of the cell's mitotic spindle or positioned by a spatial cue taken from the cell's medial nucleus. How does cytokinesis differ in animal and plant cells? In animal cells cytokinesis occurs when a cleavage furrow (a groove in the cell surface) forms around the cell. This furrow narrows the cell across the centre and eventually p … inches it into two new cells. In plant cells a cleavage furrow does not form.

Best Answer: plants have a cell wall that divides the cell into two new cells animal cells are split with protine strands to form two new cells Answers. 1  well from my knowledge, cytokinesis in an animal cell- in an animal cell the cell membrane is drawn inward until the cytoplasm is pinched into 2 nearly equal parts. each part that has been divided has a nucleus and organelles.

Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) represent a recently discovered cell population which has been implicated in driving Th2 inflammation in CRS; however, their relationship with clinical disease characteristics has yet to be investigated. The aim of this study was to identify ILC2s in sinus mucosa in patients with CRS and controls and compare ILC2s across characteristics of disease. A cross-sectional study of patients with CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery was conducted. Sinus mucosal biopsies were obtained during surgery and control tissue from patients undergoing pituitary tumour resection through transphenoidal approach. ILC2s were identified as CD45(+) Lin(-) CD127(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) CRTH2(CD294)(+) CD161(+) cells in single cell suspensions through flow cytometry. ILC2 frequencies, measured as a percentage of CD45(+) cells, were compared across CRS phenotype, endotype, inflammatory CRS subtype and other disease characteristics including blood eosinophils, serum IgE, asthma status and nasal symptom score. 35 patients (40% female, age 48 ± 17 years) including 13 with eosinophilic CRS (eCRS), 13 with non-eCRS and 9 controls were recruited. ILC2 frequencies were associated with the presence of nasal polyps (P = 0.002) as well as high tissue eosinophilia (P = 0.004) and eosinophil-dominant CRS (P = 0.001) (Mann-Whitney U). They were also associated with increased blood eosinophilia (P = 0.005). There were no significant associations found between ILC2s and serum total IgE and allergic disease. In the CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) population, ILC2s were increased in patients with co-existing asthma (P = 0.03). ILC2s were also correlated with worsening nasal symptom score in CRS (P = 0.04).\nOutput:\nAre group 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2s ) increased in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps or eosinophilia?\n\nInput:\nPsammaplin A (PsA) is a natural product isolated from marine sponges, which has been demonstrated to have anticancer activity against several human cancer cell lines via the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. New drugs that are less toxic and more effective against multidrug-resistant cancers are urgently needed. We tested cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and autophagic cell death pathway in doxorubicin-resistant MCF-7 (MCF-7/adr) human breast cancer cells. The potency of PsA was further determined using an in vivo xenograft model.\nOutput:\nDoes psammaplin A induce Sirtuin 1-dependent autophagic cell death in doxorubicin-resistant MCF-7/adr human breast cancer cells and xenografts?\n\nInput:\nOur study reexamines the prevalence of interval colorectal cancer (I-CRC) by manually reviewing CRC cases at a single institution.', 'In 2% to 8% of patients with CRC, diagnosis occurs during the interval 6 to 36 months after a cancer-free colonoscopy. Rates are often determined by linking the date of colonoscopy with cancer registry information.', 'We examined all colonoscopies from 1993 to 2011. These examinations were linked with Pennsylvania Cancer Registry data. Matched charts were manually reviewed. We determined whether the CRC was \"prevalent\" or, for patients with a previous colonoscopy, whether they were interval or noninterval based on time from last colonoscopy. For interval cases, we identified \"administrative errors\" that could falsely increase the number of reported I-CRC.', 'Over the study period, 43,661 colonoscopies were performed, with 1147 (2.6%) positive for CRC after excluding cases (n=52) in which patients had IBD, previous surgery, or nonadenocarcinoma malignancy. Prevalent CRCs totaled 1062 (92.6%). Noninterval CRCs (diagnosed over 36 mo from index colonoscopy) were present in 40 (3.5%). There remained 45 (3.9%) potential I-CRC cases. However, after manual review, 21 cases were found to be administrative errors. Therefore, the accurate proportion of colonoscopies that found an I-CRC was 2.1% (95% confidence interval, 1.5%-3.2%).\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Does administrative Database Research overestimate the Rate of Interval Colon Cancer?"}]}

While one claims to be a witch through persuasion from the church, one denies it, another does neither and curses the priest. He orders them hanged and drowned. That done, he urges the guards to pull them back up for a ritual to make sure the so-called witches never come back to life. The guards refuse, claiming they are dead enough. The priest returns late at night to perform the ritual. One of the corpses, one of a hag with a blind eye suffers a seizure but dies, While another corpse, a younger woman takes on a demonic appearance and kills the priest.In the 14th century, Teutonic Knights Behmen von Bleibruck (Cage) and Felson (Perlman) are engaged on a crusade, taking part in several different battles throughout the 1330s and eventually in the Smyrniote crusades. After witnessing the massacre of civilians during the 1344 capture of Smyrna, the two knights desert the Order and the crusade and return to Austria.While traveling through Styria, Behmen and Felson encounter the grotesque sight of people infected with the Black Death and discover that the Holy Roman Empire has been swept by the plague. They enter an unnamed town, trying to conceal their identity as deserters, but are revealed as knights by the crest on Behmen's sword. They are arrested and taken to Cardinal D'Ambroise, who is infected with the plague. The Cardinal asks the knights to escort an alleged witch suspected of causing the plague to a remote monastery, where an elite group of monks reside. These monks can determine if the girl is truly a witch, and if she is found guilty, know a sacred ritual to cancel her powers and stop the plague that is devastating Europe. The two knights agree under the condition she be given a fair trial and that the charges of desertion against them be dropped. The Cardinal agrees and they set out accompanied by a priest, Debelzaq; a young altar boy, Kay von Wollenbarth, who wants to become a knight like his deceased father; a knight, Johann Eckhardt, whose family was killed by the plague; and the well-traveled swindler Hagamar, who will serve as their guide to the monastery in return for a pardon. The witch, a young girl later identified as Anna from Marburg, shows hatred towards Debelzaq and forms a bond with Behmen.Shortly after setting off, the group camp for the night. Anna becomes hysterical at the prospect of being left alone with Debelzaq. She attacks him and grabs his key to the cage, then escapes, fleeing toward a nearby village. The search for her leads the group to a mass grave, where Eckhart has visions of his dead daughter. Chasing the visions, he impales himself on Kay's sword and dies. When they recapture her, the tearful Anna explains that she only ran away for fear of Debelzaq. However the group gradually becomes less trusting of her. They cross a rickety rope bridge, where Anna saves Kay from falling to his death by grabbing him with one hand, showing unnatural strength. The group enters the dark forest called Wormwood, where Hagamar attempts to kill Anna so that the group can go home, only to be stopped by the others. Anna appears to summon monstrous wolves, which chase the group and kill Hagamar. An enraged Behmen tries to kill Anna, but is stopped by Debelzaq and Felson, who point out that the monastery is in sight.At the monastery, the men find that all the monks have been killed by the plague, but locate the Key of Solomon, an ancient book filled with holy rituals used to defeat evil. The men confront Anna, and Debelzaq begins to perform a ritual used on witches. However, as Anna begins precisely recounting Behmen's past actions during the Crusades, Debelzaq realizes that she is not a witch, and begins frantically performing an exorcism. However, the demon that is possessing Anna reveals himself and melts the metal of the cage. He fights off the knights effortlessly, but when Debelzaq throws a vial of holy water on him, the demon flies out of sight. As the men search for the demon, they realize he is not trying to escape, but to destroy the book so that nothing can stop his powers. They find a room where the monks were writing copies of the book, where the demon, revealing himself to be Baal, destroys the copies and possesses the dead monks' bodies to use as weapons. The three men fight the possessed monks while Debelzaq continues the exorcism ritual. During the fight, Baal/Anna breaks Debelzaq's neck, then kills Felson. Kay picks up the book and continues the ritual, while Behmen continues fighting Baal/Anna. Behmen is mortally wounded during the fight, but Kay is able to finish the ritual and Baal is expelled from Anna's body, freeing her. Behmen asks Kay to keep Anna safe and then dies of his wounds.Kay and Anna bury their fallen friends. Anna asks Kay to tell her about the men who saved her. They depart from the monastery with the book., Question: What's the name of the guide to the monastery?\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Hagamar"}]}

There's reason for saying this. In 2012, the reality talent show , the voice of China, on the Zhejiang Television became the most popular program in China. The reaon for its popularity was really because its excellent quality? Or can we assume that without any opponent, we can't tell a contestant is winning because he is really talented or because there's no comparison? The administrative department really contributed a lot in the popularity of the voice of China. In the past, there was no other draft shows  ranked as high as Super GirlandSuper Boy. Even though there were some draft shows which seemed to share the popularity, it never turned out ture. All the other draft shows were shodowed by the ones on Hunan TV. One example was that since draft shows of Hunan TV were broadcast on Friday night, the draft shows of other stations were shifted to Saturday or Sunday. However, Hunan TV didn't get their permission for broadcasting shows in 2012. And if this were not bad enough, SARFT did a great favor for it. SARFT issued a regulation, saying that all draft shows should be broadcast after 10:30 pm at night. Zhejiang TV declared long before the regulation that since was \"no audition , no PK, no rise in rank, no voting, no champion\", its program was never a draft show. So, in 2012, all the opponents of Zhejiang TV had to broadcast their draft shows after 10:30 pm while the voice of Chinawas permitted to be broadcast in prime time. If you really think about it, there's no esential different between a draft show and the voice of China. It also selected people from all over the country, how did they say this were different from a draft show? No PK,really? PK doesn't mean one versus one! A team versus a team is called PK too. And \"no rise in rank?\" is just a switch of concepts because at the end of every game, some left the stage and some stayed. If there was really \"no champion\", how come there was only one \"good voice of China\" at the final round? All these were rising in rank, in disguise . Under such cimcumstance, the voice of Chinaeven got praise. We are not saying that it is not a good show: we are saying that there's regret about the show since it had no opponent. \n Question: The following factors are important in making the voice of China popular EXCEPT   _  . \n Options: (A) the unique quality of the voice of China (B) the policy support from SARFT and the administrative department (C) the favorable broadcasting time. (D) the shortage of good opponents \n Asnwer: A\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes"}]}

One has a significant and poignant message, the other is as one-dimensional as a religious movie can get. Too bad Paul Anderson went on to the accursed Resident Evil movies, he really had something going.Thief in the Night is hampered by many obvious independent film attributes (acting, storytelling, dialog, and persuasion) and it's obvious what the film's intentions are from the start. The Christian film industry hasn't learned from the failures of this, so we are stuck with The Omega Code, Left Behind, and the other Tribulation movies. Their underlying element is that they are so concerned with selling their message: \"Get saved, folks!\" that everything else becomes second to whacking the audience over the head with a Bible.Overall, I can't believe I'm even writing this much about a movie this ineffective.

Certainly the stuff he'd been helping Chloe and her gang of followers do for the last few hours was technically illegal. He'd asked them why they were helping him, what did they hope to gain? They'd told him that this is what they did for fun. Chloe assured him that they \"lived for this kinda shit.\" Ok, fine. He could sort of see that. Once he was there, helping them come up with the plan and then actually carrying it out, it sure as hell was exciting - probably the most exciting thing he'd ever done. Now that he was home and alone with his misgivings and paranoia, it all seemed like a really stupid idea. If it weren't for Chloe and her mesmerizing enthusiasm, there's no doubt that he wouldn't be doing this at all. But it was too late now. Or was it? It was five in the morning when Paul got back to his apartment. He'd told Chloe that he wanted to get a few hours sleep before the big meeting, but he now realized that there was no way he was going to be able to relax. When he'd stepped out the door twenty-two hours earlier he'd still had his job and was looking forward to a showing the rest of the art team his new designs for some of the higher-level monsters he wanted to add to the game. Screw that, he thought, they're my monsters now. I'll use them somewhere else. It could never work. How could it? Right then and there Paul decided that he was going to call the whole thing off. It wasn't too late. They hadn't done anything yet that wasn't reversible. No one had been hurt. No money had changed hands. No one had been lied to. If he called it off right now he could just move on and try and put the whole, sorry state of affairs behind him.\nOutput:\nWho has mesmerizing enthusiasm?\n\nInput:\nKurt Vonnegut, writer and famous speech giver at US university graduation ceremonies, made this point to one group of soon-to-be-non-students: If this isn't nice, I don't know what is. It is the end of a story about his grandpa who, on a summer's afternoon, would find the shade of a tree under which he could rest with a glass of homemade lemonade. The family didn't have a lot of cash, the grandpa worked hard every day of his life, but no matter how relentless the day-to-day was, he would always repeat this phrase as a reminder to those around him that, at the end of the day, this is all still amazing to be part of. This kind of optimism, as you might call it, can often disappear in a flash in the busy-ness of business or school. Things become impossible, hardgoing, relentless(ly difficult). And the reasons we give for that busyness nearly always involve someone or something else - the system, the job, the weather... For many years, people would ask the salutary \"how are you?\" and my answer was a stock one: \"I'm tired.\" It was my wife who pointed it out to me, presumably because everyone else was too polite to express their boredom with my reply. The fact is, most people feel tired most of the time, until they make a switch in their life. That switch is deciding that the only person who can turn that frown upside down, who can make crazy stuff happen (or attempt to, and enjoy the process), is you. And in Vonnegut's case, that switch came from saying out loud the one phrase that brings us back to the good elements in what we or our team or our family is doing at any given moment: If this isn't nice, I don't know what is.\nOutput:\nWho is the writer and famous speech giver at US university graduations?\n\nInput:\nU.S. President Donald Trump says he may veto a $1.3 trillion spending bill because it does not offer protections for young undocumented immigrants who arrived as children and does not fully fund the border wall.\nIn a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he is considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on \"the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\"\nPreviously, White House officials said Trump would sign the spending package, a move that would head off a potential government shutdown due to a lack of funding.\nThe measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.\nThe Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday.\nLawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night.\n\nWith midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill considers major legislation this year. The measure fulfills Trump's vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel.\nAfter extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides $1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the $25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi touted the agreement in a letter to her Democratic colleagues, saying negotiators \"fought for and achieved drastic reductions to the Trump/GOP plan,\" including much less funding for the wall than Trump requested and a limit on the number of immigrants that can be detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Who is the House Minority Leader?"}]}

La programación de GPUs es un tema muy actual en HPC.  Existen problemas en la presentación del artículo y las imágenes no están bien contextualizadas.  Implementaciones y comparaciones de performance entre GPU y CPU son un tema ya abordado en trabajos existentes.  El artículo describe en forma relativamente específica la implementación y sus detalles, en conjunto con los problemas encontrados.  El tema de programación GPU es un tema muy actual en computación de alto rendimiento y su comparación con programación basada en CPU me parece relevante.  Sería recomendable mejorar el orden del artículo, relacionando de mejor manera las imágenes y tablas. Existen faltas de ortografía evidentes dentro del contenido del trabajo. Review_2: El manuscrito involucra el uso de GPU, tecnología que desde hace un par de años cada vez tiene más que decir en el área de HPC. El documento tiene estructura relativamente buena, se realizan comparaciones y hay algunos gráficos interesantes.  El documento tiene algunas falencias que lo hacen confuso, por ejemplo, la pagina 7 es un completo desorden, la Figura 7 no está bien explicada, las tablas se tratan como figuras, hay diferencia entre lo que representa una imagen y un gráfico, por lo cual deben ser tratadas de forma independientes. Hay un texto que explica la Figura 6, que por cierto es una tabla, ese texto no es parte del cuerpo del paper, o si?, es muy difícil leer esa página. Yo no soy experto en el algoritmo SIFT, por lo cual al leer el paper no me queda claro si usaron el código SiftGPU creado por Changchang Wu o lo tomaron como base y le aplicaron unas modificaciones.  Por otro lado, hubiera sido interesante saber por qué la implementación en CUDA, la implementación en multicore y la serial podrían arrojar resultados diferentes, si al fin y al cabo los tres enfoques son el algoritmo SIFT. Hace más de 12 años que programo aplicaciones paralelas y para un mismo algoritmo nunca que observado resultados diferentes, si al fin y al cabo el algoritmo es el mismo, ahora, cuando se introducen variantes al algoritmo original con el fin de forzar el paralelismo, se tienen resultados diferentes, pero ya deja de ser el algoritmo original.  Leyendo otros papers sobre el tema, no encuentro tanta originalidad, el documento tampoco ayuda mucho para sacar conclusiones.  El paper tiene datos de corridas y compara distintos enfoques, pero me queda la gran duda del por qué un mismo algoritmo con un enfoque secuencial y otro paralelo con GPU puedan arrojar resultados distintos.  GPU es un asunto que tiene sus gracias, sobre todo por el ahorro en dinero que implica su uso en el largo plazo, por lo podría ser bueno divulgar este trabajo para divulgar esta tecnología.  El documento esta desordenado, falta diferenciar lo que es una figura, de un gráfico y de una tabla, además la pagina 7 es muy difícil de leer y la explicación de las tablas de datos se confunde con el cuerpo del paper.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "accept"}]}

Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.\n\nThe purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.\n\nA risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant. \nStory: Farmers Dan and Joey bot got into sugaring fruit and veggies, as they are vegan. Dan candied apples, pears, plums and quince. Joey candied ginger, peaches, pineapple and oranges but had some humidity in the room the fruit didn't turn out right.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Which farmer had fewer fruits fermenting because of humidity?"}]}

Subsequently, 26 patients received CBT for psychosis (CBT+treatment-as-usual [TAU], 19 completers) for 6-8 months, and 26 continued with TAU alone (17 completers). Symptoms in both patient groups were assessed (blindly) at entry and follow-up.', 'The CBT+TAU and TAU-alone groups did not differ clinically or in performance at baseline. The CBT+TAU group showed significant improvement in relation to the TAU-alone group, which showed no change, at follow-up. Stronger dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity (within the normal range) and DLPFC-cerebellum connectivity during the highest memory load condition (2-back > 0-back) were associated with post-CBT clinical improvement.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Does dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity predict responsiveness to cognitive-behavioral therapy in schizophrenia?"}]}

Although this has been shown to occur after endocytosis of APP from the cell surface, the exact compartments of APP processing are not well defined. We have previously demonstrated that APP and gamma-secretase proteins and activity are highly enriched in purified rat liver lysosomes. In order to examine the lysosomal distribution and trafficking of APP in cultured cells, we generated constructs containing APP fused to a C-terminal fluorescent protein tag and N-terminal HA-epitope tag. These were co-transfected with a panel of fluorescent-protein tagged compartment markers. Here we demonstrate using laser-scanning confocal microscopy that although APP is present throughout the endosomal/lysosomal system in transfected Cos7 and neuronal SN56 cell lines as well as in immunostained cultured mouse neurons, it is enriched in the lysosome. We also show that the Swedish and London mutations reduce the amount of APP in the lysosome. Surprisingly, in addition to its expected trafficking from the cell surface to the early and then late endosomes, we find that cell-surface labelled APP is transported rapidly and directly from the cell surface to lysosomes in both Cos7 and SN56 cells. This rapid transit to the lysosome is blocked by the presence of either the London or Swedish mutations. These results demonstrate the presence of a novel, rapid and specific transport pathway from the cell surface to the lysosomes. This suggests that regulation of lysosomal traffic could regulate APP processing and that the lysosome could play a central role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Which disease the London mutation involved in?"}]}

You may recall that I'd been helping out a local charity with their website? Well that is all completed now but I've had some other family stuff going on and with looking after my baby daughter spare time for blogging is pretty scarce at the moment. I haven't lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space!\nToday I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again!\nMooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows!\nMoogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home!\nThere are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I've been using the one for Oily Skin but it's also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils' that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay. Question: Who reviewed the moisturizer?\nOutput:\nThe Narrator\n\nInput:\nJuliette Murray was, like me, a kid at school who got 5 \"A\"s, which in the West of Scotland put a certain degree of pressure on one's shoulders to study either medicine or law. I studied European Law, and became a teacher - that's what a European Law degree does to you. She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next.\nMurray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors.\nShe set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other's blood pressure. They have more chance of a realistic insight by breaking their arm and turning up to Accident and Emergency. As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option. So, the question became: how might we offer a more realistic experience of what being a doctor, surgeon or other medical profession feels like?\nStarting with her local hospital, Wishaw General in NHS Lanarkshire, she set about overcoming what she describes as a \"culture of obstacles\". Two years later, though, and students are indeed undertaking real life surgery work experience, experiencing a live operation theatre and seeing the pressure of the job first hand. Question: What was Juliette's degree in?\nOutput:\nMedicine\n\nInput:\nThanks Richard for asking. Yes. I have something to tell. We have record rainfall during 24 hours in Lahore, breaking previous one day record by more than 60%. Our drainage system is pathetic. Other systems such as telephone, electricity, cable etc. are no better. Poor planning has further been aggravated by extremely mismanaged maintenance and operational bugs.\nThis morning, when I was out for our fajr (morning prayers) in masjid, a neighbor told me that the pole laden with electricity meters was under fire. After that he buzzed off for complaint office.\nWhen I returned after prayers, I saw fire reaching cable part after meter; one meter had caught fire and other meters (including ours) was in danger of catching fire. It was still dark. I waited for someone to come out. No one appeared. I came inside and told my wife about and went again out to see if I could find someone to go about extinguishing fire. IT WAS DAM RISKY AS DIGGING WAS DONE BY TELEPHONE COMPANY AND RAINS HAD MADE A MESS ON OUR STREET. No one was seen.\nMy wife came out; brought hose pipe. I managed to use it as water gun and there was some post-extinguishing sparking; fire was put out. I want to add here that hose pipe should only be used when someone knows how to send bursts of water so that electric current cannot build a circuit.\nLater in day we heard about the most stupid thing; people were inside their houses, watching flames from pole but not knowing what to do. THEY DID NOT EVEN COME OUT TO SHARE THE ACTIVITY.\nThat has happened today. I am going to ask everyone about it one by one. Also, I am still looking for the guy who went to complaint office and was never seen thereafter this morning.\nThat can happen to anybody. Question: Who asked the narrator to describe this event?\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Richard"}]}

Great product, Review_8: While I like the Dream Machine I don't know why there's so much static. It's nearly impossible to get a couple of my favorite radio stations without constant static in the background. My other radio doesn't do that. I've even tried different locations for it. That's a big disappointment and shortcoming of the product.\nOutput:\nThis FM/AM radio, iPhone docking station and alarm clock is a perfect combination! The sound is amazing, the alarm clock is not annoying, and the design looks great! It would be nice to have a place to use an aux cord and certain apple products require a $5 adapter to use the docking station but other than that, this product is fantastic!\n\nInput:\nReview_1: The only thing I would like to see is an aux cord when I don't want to charge my phone, but It's not a huge deal. The sound is great, and worth the money. The remote works with your phone, and that's precisely what I wanted, Review_2: you need to buy an adaptor for Ipod Nano's so it was disappointing when my son opened it up on Christmas and could not use it for his Ipod Nano. It does not state that anywhere on the box or when I ordered it., Review_3: Love, love, love the ability to save multiple preset radio stations, and the sound is clear, crisp... amazing! It almost makes waking up a pleasure. Another feature I never thought I wanted, but really appreciate, is the ability to set the brightness of the clock readout. Brilliant!, Review_4: The sound of the radio is of real quality. I also like having the two separate alarms and the alarm is not obnoxious yet still wakes us up. My wife charges her iphone on it regularly and works out well. We like the Sony so much I got one for my son and his wife for a Christmas present, Review_5: I was looking quite awhile to locate a decent sounding radio / iPod player which would also charge my iPod. This is perfect for our family. It's a lot smaller than I thought, which is good. And when we update to an iPhone 5, there is a $5 adapter to get so we can still use this radio. Perfect!, Review_6: As always, Sony has a 'winner' in this combined am / fm radio and docking station. Great sound, looks good and wife is very pleased as she put it in her craft work area. Finding the combo of am / fm wasn't easy either.Lots of fm only units. This is a great product., Review_7: My husband really like this speaker... LOVE IT!

That's a big disappointment and shortcoming of the product.\nOutput:\nThe Sony product is great and the radio have high quality speaker. It is also packed with the capacity to charge other gadgets. The remote control can also work with phones which makes it comfortable and a great buy. Though it can sometimes be difficult to get and switch stations with some constant static.\n\nInput:\nReview_1: I looked at a few sizing charts and they said that 'one size fits all' will fit a head with a circumference of 21 1 / 2 '- 22 1 / 4'. My head is 21 3 / 4 'and this hat sat on the top of my ears! I have returned it., Review_2: Loved the stitching design, got a lot of compliements on it. The best part is you can roll it up and pack in your suitcase for travel and it unfolds beautifully. Provides the right amount of coverage and stayed on my head in windy conditions., Review_3: I needed something for my cruise to Hawaii. I ordered this atthe last moment, but Amazon came through and I receivedit the day before I left. I love the look, the feel, the factthat I can fold it and stick it in my suitcase and, best of all, I received compliments on it., Review_4: I spent 2 months at the beach this summer and this hat was great. It kept my head cool even in nearly 100 degree weather and also kept my face protected. I have a fairly large head and had no problem with the one size fits all., Review_5: I wear a hat anytime I am outside for any length of time. This hat is cute and provides great sun protection. I have a hat for hiking and a hat for the beach, but this is for more dressy occasions like an outdoor birthday party or a trip to Butterfly World with my granddaughter., Review_6: Good quality hat, I love that I can be protected from the sun, and look good too! I'd also like to commend customer service, which was responsive and helpful when I accidentally shipped my order to the wrong address. I have already ordered another hat for my daughter., Review_7: I bought two of these hats to keep on our son's boat. They are pretty stylish but most importantly does protect my hair and face from the sun. Love the UPF protection. The only nominally downside is it is difficult to stay on when the boat is going fast. I think for wear at the beach or just outside it is a great purchase., Review_8: It looks good; it's comfortable; it keeps the sun off my face & neck. I wear it while gardening or for walks. I got it in the Moss Green and the color is as shown online. I'm glad I bought it.\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The hat is comfortable, stylish and easy to pack into a suitcase for travel.

The first official Paralympic Games, no longer open solely to war veterans, was held in Rome in 1960 Summer Paralympics. 400 athletes from 23 countries competed at the 1960 Games. Since 1960, the Paralympic Games have taken place in the same year as the Olympic Games. The Games were initially open only to athletes in wheelchairs; at the 1976 Summer Paralympics, athletes with different disabilities were included for the first time at a Summer Paralympics. With the inclusion of more disability classifications the 1976 Summer Games expanded to 1,600 athletes from 40 countries. The 1988 Summer Paralympics in Seoul, South Korea, was another milestone for the Paralympic movement. It was in Seoul that the Paralympic Summer Games were held directly after the 1988 Summer Olympics, in the same host city, and using the same facilities. This set a precedent that was followed in 1992 Summer Paralympics, 1996 Summer Paralympics and 2000 Summer Paralympics. It was eventually formalized in an agreement between the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 2001, and was extended through 2020. On March 10, 2018, the two committees further extended their contract to 2032.

Immediately in front of the Main Building and facing it, is a copper statue of Christ with arms upraised with the legend \"Venite Ad Me Omnes\". Next to the Main Building is the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. Immediately behind the basilica is the Grotto, a Marian place of prayer and reflection. It is a replica of the grotto at Lourdes, France where the Virgin Mary reputedly appeared to Saint Bernadette Soubirous in 1858. At the end of the main drive (and in a direct line that connects through 3 statues and the Gold Dome), is a simple, modern stone statue of Mary.\nOutput:\nTo whom did the Virgin Mary allegedly appear in 1858 in Lourdes France?\n\nInput:\nContext: The university is the major seat of the Congregation of Holy Cross (albeit not its official headquarters, which are in Rome). Its main seminary, Moreau Seminary, is located on the campus across St. Joseph lake from the Main Building. Old College, the oldest building on campus and located near the shore of St. Mary lake, houses undergraduate seminarians. Retired priests and brothers reside in Fatima House (a former retreat center), Holy Cross House, as well as Columba Hall near the Grotto. The university through the Moreau Seminary has ties to theologian Frederick Buechner. While not Catholic, Buechner has praised writers from Notre Dame and Moreau Seminary created a Buechner Prize for Preaching.\nOutput:\nWhere is the headquarters of the Congregation of the Holy Cross?\n\nInput:\nContext: Since the construction of its oldest buildings, the university's physical plant has grown substantially. Over the years 29 residence halls have been built to accommodate students and each has been constructed with its own chapel. Many academic building were added together with a system of libraries, the most prominent of which is the Theodore Hesburgh Library, built in 1963 and today containing almost 4 million books. Since 2004, several buildings have been added, including the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, the Guglielmino Complex, and the Jordan Hall of Science. Additionally, a new residence for men, Duncan Hall, was begun on March 8, 2007, and began accepting residents for the Fall 2008 semester. Ryan Hall was completed and began housing undergraduate women in the fall of 2009. A new engineering building, Stinson-Remick Hall, a new combination Center for Social Concerns/Institute for Church Life building, Geddes Hall, and a law school addition have recently been completed as well. Additionally the new hockey arena opened in the fall of 2011. The Stayer Center for Executive Education, which houses the Mendoza College of Business Executive Education Department opened in March 2013 just South of the Mendoza College of Business building. Because of its long athletic tradition, the university features also many building dedicated to sport. The most famous is Notre Dame Stadium, home of the Fighting Irish football team; it has been renovated several times and today it can hold more than 80 thousand people. Prominent venues include also the Edmund P. Joyce Center, with indoor basketball and volleyball courts, and the Compton Family Ice Arena, a two-rink facility dedicated to hockey.

Despite the difficulties of the job, clowning is Will's one escape from the realities of his miserable existence: Will genuinely likes kids, and takes great joy from making them happy on their birthdays.Struggling to make ends meet, but not wanting to give up his dream job, Will comes up with the idea to be a \"bachelor party clown.\" Will's idea is that men throwing bachelor parties can hire him as well as a stripper; Will enters the room prior to the \"real\" entertainment, wearing clown makeup and lingerie, tricking the bachelor into thinking that there was a mix-up and a gay clown stripper has been sent in lieu of a female one. Will invents the persona of Vulgar the Clown (after his friend Syd tells him that the entire idea is \"vulgar\") and solicits himself in the want-ads. Before long, he is hired to appear at a bachelor party being held at a nearby motel.When Will arrives for the party â wearing stockings, garters, clown makeup, and a trench-coat â he is attacked and brutally beaten by a middle-aged man, Ed, and his sons Gino and Frankie. The three men then proceed to gang rape Will, taking turns videotaping the attack. The trio hold Will hostage in the motel room for an indeterminate amount of time, during which they subject him to a series of violent and humiliating sexual assaults. They also break a bottle over his head and drug him. A tearful Will goes home and spends the remainder of the night and part of the next morning crying while he washes himself clean in the bathtub.Will spends a considerable amount of time after the attack in a crippling depression, which nearly costs him his home. Eventually, Will fulfills a promise to appear as a clown at one of his past-clients' children's party. When he gets to the party, Will discovers a hostage crisis is occurring; the father of one of the children, in the middle of divorce proceedings, has kidnapped his own daughter and is threatening to kill her. In a near-suicidal reaction, Will sneaks past the police barricade, breaks into the house, and subdues the father. News reporters capture some of the event on film, and before long the story makes national headlines. Will becomes known as \"the hero clown;\" the attention and outpouring of support breaks him out of his depression, and he is eventually given his own syndicated children's television show.The media coverage attracts the attention of Ed and his sons (who are still raping young men). They threaten Will with a copy of the tape of his being raped (edited to look like amateur porn) and begin to extort him. When Will tries to pay the men off, they attack him in a bathroom stall. Will finally strikes an agreement with the men wherein he will come to a motel room and \"perform\" for them, allowing himself to be taken advantage of again, and they will give him all of the copies of the tape; secretly, Will plans to ambush and murder them with the help of Syd.When the time comes, the gun jams and Will finds himself unable to kill his tormentors. Just as Ed and his sons move in to rape and murder Will, Ed's son Frankie accidentally shoots himself in the face. Then, a shootout ensues with a vagrant lowlife at the hotel, who robs Syd and then plots to do the same to the others. Both the man and Ed's other son (Gino) are shot to death. Ed panics, and Will chases him through the motel parking lot to a nearby playground. As Will approaches him, Ed has a massive heart attack and starts to die. Will takes off as he hears police sirens coming. His conscience clear, Will retrieves the tape and goes on to live happily ever after, hosting his television show.Extended ending[edit]The director's cut DVD features an extended ending, wherein Will finds a note from Syd along with a clipped newspaper article on the Fanelli's death, Ed's heart failure from panic and overdose of crack cocaine, as well as attributing Ed's sons' (as well as the vagrant lowlife's) deaths to a random incidence of criminal violence and natural circumstance. A stunned Will determines that the men's deaths were all karmic retribution.\n\n### Response:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Question: Who does Ed hold hostage?, Answer: Will"}]}

They later have sex at Clarences apartment in downtown Detroit. Alabama tearfully confesses that she is a call girl hired by Clarences boss as a birthday present but has fallen in love with Clarence. They marry. An apparition of Elvis visits Clarence and convinces him to kill Alabamas pimp Drexl. Clarence goes to the brothel where Alabama worked, shoots and kills Drexl, and takes a bag he assumes contains Alabamas belongings. Back at the apartment, he and Alabama discover the bag contains a large amount of cocaine. The couple visit Clarences estranged father, Clifford, a former cop and now a security guard, for help. Clifford tells Clarence that the police assume Drexls murder is a gang killing. After the couple leave for Los Angeles, Clifford is interrogated by Don Vincenzo Coccotti, consigliere to a mobster named Blue Lou Boyle, who wants the drugs. Clifford, realizing he will die anyway, mockingly defies Coccotti. Infuriated, Coccotti shoots Clifford dead. A note on the refrigerator leads the mobsters to Clarences Los Angeles address. In Los Angeles, Clarence and Alabama meet Clarences friend Dick, an aspiring actor. Dick introduces Clarence to a friend of his, actor Elliot Blitzer, who reluctantly agrees to broker the sale of the drugs to film producer Lee Donowitz. While Clarence is out buying lunch, Coccottis underboss, Virgil, finds Alabama in her motel room and beats her for information. She fights back and kills him with his shotgun. Elliot is pulled over for speeding and arrested for drug possession. To stay out of jail, he agrees to record the drug deal between Clarence and Donowitz for the police. Coccottis crew learn where the deal will take place from Dicks roommate Floyd. Clarence, Alabama, Dick, and Elliot go to Donowitzs suite at the Ambassador Hotel with the drugs. In the elevator, a suspicious Clarence threatens Elliot at gunpoint, but is persuaded by Elliotts pleading. Clarence fabricates a story for Donowitz that the drugs were given to him by a corrupt cop, and Donowitz agrees to the sale. Clarence excuses himself to the bathroom, where a vision of Elvis reassures him that things are going well. Donowitz and his bodyguards are ambushed by the cops and mobsters and a shootout begins after Elliott accidentally reveals himself as an informant. Dick abandons the drugs and flees. Almost everyone is killed in the gun battle, and Clarence is wounded as he exits the bathroom. He and Alabama escape with Donowitzs money as more police arrive. They flee to Mexico where Alabama gives birth to a son, whom she names Elvis."}]}

It is an unincorporated part of and the county seat of the City and County of Honolulu on the island of Oahu. The city is the main gateway to Hawaii and a major portal into the United States. The city is also a major hub for international business, military defense, as well as famously being host to a diverse variety of east-west and Pacific culture, cuisine, and traditions. \n\nHonolulu is the most remote city of its size in the world and is the westernmost major U.S. city. For statistical purposes, the U.S. Census Bureau recognizes the approximate area commonly referred to as \"City of Honolulu\" (not to be confused with the \"City and County\") as a census county division (CCD). Honolulu is a major financial center of the islands and of the Pacific Ocean. The population of the city of Honolulu was 337,256 as of the 2010 census, while the Honolulu CCD was 390,738 and the population of the consolidated city and county was 953,207. \n\n\"Honolulu\" means \"sheltered harbor\" or \"calm port\". The old name is said to be Kou, a district roughly encompassing the area from Nuuanu Avenue to Alakea Street and from Hotel Street to Queen Street which is the heart of the present downtown district. The city has been the capital of the Hawaiian Islands since 1845 and gained historical recognition following the attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan near the city on December 7, 1941.\", \"question: \" \"What does Honolulu mean?\"\nOutput:\nMacau\n\nInput:\n\"story\": \"Ellie and her grandfather went to the beach late in the afternoon. \n\n\"Why are we going to the beach, Grandpa?\" Ellie asked. \n\nHe smiled a big old smile. \"We're looking for treasure,\" he said.

The whole history of those days would never be known by another man! Upon Trent they had left their mark for ever. Every hour of his time in this country he reckoned of great value--yet he had devoted fourteen days to saving the life of John Francis. Such days too--and such nights! They had carried him sometimes in a dead stupor, sometimes a raving madman, along a wild bush-track across rivers and swamps into the town of Garba, where years ago a Congo trader, who had made a fortune, had built a little white-washed hospital! He was safe now, but surely never a man before had walked so near the \"Valley of the Shadow of Death.\" A single moment's vigilance relaxed, a blanket displaced, a dose of brandy forgotten, and Trent might have walked this life a multi-millionaire, a peer, a little god amongst his fellows, freed for ever from all anxiety. But Francis was tended as never a man was tended before. Trent himself had done his share of the carrying, ever keeping his eyes fixed upon the death-lit face of their burden, every ready to fight off the progress of the fever and ague, as the twitching lips or shivering limbs gave warning of a change. For fourteen days he had not slept; until they had reached Garba his clothes had never been changed since they had started upon their perilous journey. As he rode into Attra he reeled a little in his saddle, and he walked into the office of the Agent more like a ghost than a man.

During this period, Lan Na constantly raided their neighbors to their south while Ayutthaya repeatedly mounted invasions in retaliation. Ramathibodi II became king of Ayutthaya in 1491 and ruled until 1529. He instituted compulsory military service to help fight his wars. The Burmese-Siamese War in 1547-49 was inconclusive. A much more dangerous threat developed when Bayinnaung became king of Burma in 1551. Starting in 1563 Bayinnaung conquered both Lan Na and Ayutthaya. The Burmese were not ejected until the Thai revolt of 1587. \nQuestion: How many years is it said the fight resumed? \nAnswer type: Number\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "36."}]}

Amnesty documented cases of Turkish riot police firing plastic bullets and tear gas canisters at the heads of protesters.  It also   accused police of sexually abusing female demonstrators and of severely beating and shooting protesters with live ammunition, resulting in the deaths of two men in separate incidents. The report, released Wednesday, focused on the turmoil that erupted in May and June, when police tried to put down an environmentalist sit-in.  Demonstrators had staged an Occupy Wall Street-style protest over government plans to demolish Istanbul's Gezi Park and replace it with a shopping mall. \"The levels of violence used by police in the course of Gezi Park protests clearly show what happens when poorly trained, poorly supervised police officers are instructed to use force -- and encouraged to use it unsparingly -- safe in the knowledge that they are unlikely ever to be identified or prosecuted for their abuses,\" said Amnesty International's Turkey expert, Andrew Gardner. The Turkish government has launched an investigation into the possible excess use of force.  At least one police officer from a counter-terrorism unit is standing trial along with other suspects for beating a protester named Ali Ismail Korkmaz in the Turkish city of Eskisehir.  The 19-year-old university student later died as a result of his injuries. Government announces democratic reforms . Amnesty International's report emerged two days after the Turkish government unveiled a long-awaited series of reforms, which  the rights group said fails \"to address these violations or to take any serious steps to ensure that they will not occur in the future.\" Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan applauded what he called the \"democratization package,\" declaring it a historic moment for the country. The legislation lifts the ban on women wearing Islamic headscarves in public institutions.  However, women serving as police officers, judges or military personnel are still not allowed to wear headscarves. The reforms also removed the ban on teaching the Kurdish language, and ended the ban of the Kurdish letters \"q,\" \"x\" and \"w,\"  which do not exist in the Turkish alphabet. However, Kurdish can only be taught in private schools, even though it is the language spoken by Turkey's largest ethnic minority. Another change called for expanding the definition and punishment for hate crimes committed on the basis of ethnicity or religious belief. The democratization package quickly inspired a chorus of criticism from a wide range of ethnic, religious and political groups. \"This is more of an election package,\" said Sebahat Tuncel, a lawmaker from the main Kurdish opposition party, referring to municipal elections expected to be held in 2014. \"This package could have lifted the obstacles to democratization. It could have lifted barriers to freedom of the press, to freedom of expression and amended the anti-terror laws,\" Tuncel added. Thousands of Kurds have been arrested in recent years, accused of collaborating with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), whose militants have been fighting a guerrilla war for the past 30 years against the Turkish state. Erdogan's government has tried to bring an end to the simmering conflict by launching negotiations with jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan. The peace talks have prompted some of the PKK's thousands of fighters to voluntarily leave Turkey for neighboring Iraq. Meanwhile, women's groups and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual activists are upset that the reforms did not include reference to hate crimes committed on the basis of gender or sexual orientation. Though Erdogan offered to create a cultural institute for Turkey's Roma minority and promised to return a government-seized monastery to the Assyrian Christians, he stopped short of reopening the Halki Seminary, which traditionally educated the country's top Greek Orthodox clergy. For decades, members of Turkey's dwindling Greek community, as well as many Western governments, have called for Turkey to lift its ban on Halki. \"I think it is a step forward and the government says more will come,\" wrote Suat Kiniklioglu, a former lawmaker from Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), in an e-mail to CNN. \"However, the real issue in Turkey is political and cultural polarization. I wish the package would address issues such as freedom of expression and pluralism.\" Turkish president calls for reform . Turkey's president warned about the threats this polarization posed in an address before the Turkish parliament Tuesday. \"I viewed the peaceful demonstrations of the young people at Gezi Park... as a new manifestation of our democratic maturity,\" said Abdullah Gul. Gul argued that Turkey still had a long way to go in its democratization process. \"The effective and efficient operation of executive, legislative and judicial powers; the existence of a serious, constructive and strong opposition; a free, critical, impartial and independent media are of utmost importance for a country's democratic development,\" he said in his speech to lawmakers. Gul has been a loyal ally of Erdogan through the prime minister's decade in office. But as his term in the largely symbolic post of president draws to a close, Gul has increasingly challenged some of Erdogan's more controversial policies. The increasingly divergent political positions have prompted widespread speculation that Gul may be preparing to submit himself as a candidate to be the next prime minister of Turkey.\n\n### Response:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Police beat, shot, sexually abused protesters, rights group says .\nThe demonstrators wanted to keep a park from becoming a shopping mall .\nThe Turkish government has launched a probe of the alleged abuses ."}]}

However, when this emotion bleeds into other aspects of our life, it can sometimes be inappropriate or even harmful. I was personally discouraged by an adult during my high school. After telling her what university I wanted to attend, she plainly told me I would not get in. I was completely shocked and angry at her statement. The adult may have not intended to hurt me with her words, but it had an after effect. The meeting made me think she had no belief that I could possibly succeed in the future. After that it caused me to try to avoid any future meeting with adults until absolutely necessary. We are all human; therefore, we can all understand that some days are more challenging. But when people allow situations of stress to consume  them, they cannot perform their best. People should pay attention to how their reactions could affect the person they are interacting with. People have the potential to perform their best when they _ the task at hand, but adults who come off in a rude and aggressive way through communication have an effect on teenagers' mind. Adults whether in schools, or any other institutions should work to tear down walls gently and create a safe space for the person they are serving. These adults should also help and contribute to a person's academic, personal and professional growth. High school is an important time when young people need someone to believe in them. In conclusion, I would like to add that it is not completely up to adults only. Students are responsible for seeking help from adults who are in authority  positions. They are also responsible for the way they approach adults in their academic surroundings. Students can expect to be treated in a respectful way when they express at the beginning.

Auf die überzeugende Verfilmung des Romans von Edgar Allan Poe wartet die Welt bis heute. Und doch gibt es zwei Bearbeitungen des \"Untergangs des Hauses Usher\", die ansehnlich sind: Zum einen die französische Fernsehfassung mit Fanny Ardant und Mathieu Carriere aus dem Jahr 1979, zum anderen die vorliegende DVD mit Vincent Price in der Hauptrolle des Frederic Usher.

You need to come up with a fictional story that makes use of the concepts or the relationship described in the provided paragraph.

Feel free to make up places and events as long as they tie back to the background paragraph in a way that you can ask a question about.\n\nInput:\nBackground Paragraph: Acidity is an important factor for living things. For example, many plants grow best in soil that has a pH between 6 and 7. Fish may also need a pH between 6 and 7. Certain air pollutants form acids when dissolved in water droplets in the air. This results in acid fog and acid rain, which may have a pH of 4 or even lower. The pH chart in the Figure above and the Figure below reveal some of the adverse effects of acid fog and rain. Acid rain not only kills trees. It also lowers the pH of surface waters such as ponds and lakes. As a result, the water may become too acidic for fish and other water organisms to survive.\nOutput:\nSeattle recently had a power plant malfunction, resulting in increased pollutants emitted. Pittsburgh, on the other hand, has been cleaning up its factories, removing most of the air pollutants from the surrounding area.\n\nInput:\nBackground Paragraph: Alpine lakes are classified as lakes or reservoirs at high altitudes, usually starting around 5,000 feet (1524 metres) in elevation above sea level[1] or above the tree line.[2] Alpine lakes are usually clearer than lakes at lower elevations due to the colder water which decreases the speed and amount of algae and moss growth in the water. Often these lakes are surrounded by varieties of pine trees, aspens, and other high altitude trees.\nOutput:\nMichael is planning a retreat for the team members at his company and also a weekend trip with his family. After discussion with his coworkers, he decided that they were going to plan a trip to the outdoors. Lake Schmitz is high up in elevation and Lake Smith is much lower in elevation. His coworkers like to go to places with a lot of trees to relax in the shade and his family likes to go swimming in clear lakes.\n\nInput:\nBackground Paragraph: If only 1.0 mL of 0.10 M hydrochloric acid is added to 1.0 L of pure water the pH drops drastically from 7.0 to 4.0. This is a 1000-fold increase in the acidity of the solution. For many purposes, it is desirable to have a solution which is capable of resisting such large changes in pH when relatively small amounts of acid or base are added to them. Such a solution is called a buffer. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid or a base and its salt. Both components must be present for the system to act as a buffer to resist changes in pH. Commercial buffer solutions, which have a wide variety of pH values, can be obtained.\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "John is a scientist in a large pharmaceutical company.

'we will find her,' burk says. the family became concerned when adams failed to show up for her sister's birthday party the day after she talked on the phone with her mother. two days after the missed party, adams was officially reported missing. at her apartment in suburban lilburn, police found evidence suggesting foul play -- a 12-inch blood stain near her bed and a .45-caliber bullet casing. adams' car was parked in her driveway and a handwritten note was found on her door. investigators soon learned the note was from her sister, roberta. it said, 'leslie, we're worried about you, please call me as soon as possible.' watch how the mystery began with a missed party ' adams had been having trouble with her ex-boyfriend, billy joe cook, in the days leading up to her disappearance. she had accused him of stalking her and had filed a restraining order. in the court document, she alleged that cook had verbally and physically abused her. she said she feared for her life. a temporary restraining order was granted by the court, but adams vanished before a scheduled hearing on the matter. phyllis adams said her daughter told her in their final conversation that she had argued with cook over the phone on the previous day. according to the temporary restraining order, cook was not to have any contact with adams. police brought cook in for questioning and learned he had spoken to adams on the phone twice the day before she last spoke to her family. although he was questioned extensively, police have not named cook a suspect. police say he was very cooperative and there is no evidence suggesting his involvement in her disappearance, although they have not ruled him or anyone else out as a potential suspect or person of interest. just when they thought the trail had gone cold, police found what could be a lead in the case. in may 2007, clothing was recovered that could belong to the missing hair-dresser. police found a pair of men's size 8 reebok sneakers, size 10 capri pants, and a black sweater in the woods along i-85 in franklin county, 90 miles from adams' home in atlanta. they also discovered human bones and a breast implant near the clothing. police have sent the remains to a dna testing lab and they have yet to be identified. the results are inconclusive, and police continue to collect dna samples from adams family members for future tests. leslie marva adams is an african-american female who stands 5 feet 5 inches, weighs 130 pounds, and has breast implants. family members fear the remains could be leslie adams, but they are still hopeful that she will be found alive and well. burk, adams' daughter, says she struggles with her emotions at this time of year. 'i still believe she is alive and we will find her, but this time of year is very hard,' she said, fighting the tears. 'it's my aunt's birthday, the day my mom didn't show up and we never saw her again, so it's hard not to break down.' police and family urge anyone with information on the whereabouts of leslie adams to call the gwinett county police department at (770) 513-5300. there is a $25,000 reward for information that helps locate leslie adams or leads to the arrest of the person responsible for her disappearance.\nOutput:\nWhen did leslie marva adams disappear?\n\nInput:\nIn May 1918, a conservative-monarchist Senate was formed by J. K. Paasikivi, and the Senate asked the German troops to remain in Finland. 3 March 1918 Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and 7 March German-Finnish agreements bound White Finland to the German Empire's sphere of influence. General Mannerheim resigned his post on 25 May after disagreements with the Senate about German hegemony over Finland, and about his planned attack on Petrograd to repulse the Bolsheviks and capture Russian Karelia. The Germans opposed these plans due to their peace treaties with Lenin. The Civil War weakened the Finnish Parliament; it became a Rump Parliament that included only three socialist representatives. On 9 October 1918, under pressure from Germany, the Senate and Parliament elected a German prince, Friedrich Karl, the brother-in-law of German Emperor William II, to become the King of Finland. The German leadership was able to utilise the breakdown of Russia for the geopolitical benefit of the German Empire in Fennoscandia also. The Civil War and the aftermath diminished independence of Finland, compared to the status it had held at the turn of the year 1917-1918. The economic condition of Finland deteriorated drastically from 1918; recovery to pre-conflict levels was achieved only in 1925. The most acute crisis was in food supply, already deficient in 1917, though large-scale starvation had been avoided that year. The Civil War caused marked starvation in southern Finland. Late in 1918, Finnish politician Rudolf Holsti appealed for relief to Herbert Hoover, the American chairman of the Committee for Relief in Belgium. Hoover arranged for the delivery of food shipments and persuaded the Allies to relax their blockade of the Baltic Sea, which had obstructed food supplies to Finland, and to allow food into the country.\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Which happened first, the formation of a Senate, or electing a German prince?"}]}

The number of Converge Support Personnel will not exceed seven persons without VNE's prior approval. The initial Converge Support Personnel shall be identified to VNE in writing within 10 business days following the Effective Date. Converge may change the Converge Support Personnel on written notice to VNE; provided, however, that Converge shall use reasonable efforts not to change the Converge Support Personnel more frequently than once every 30 days. All replacement personnel shall be required to participate in Support Training as described in Section 3.3 below. Converge Support Personnel will be the single point of contact for the Maintenance and Support Services provided by VNE under this Section 2.\n\n            2.3 Method of Reporting. All Problem Reports and Support Requests shall be communicated by the Converge Support Personnel to VNE as follows: (1) via telephone at 1-877-249-1423, or such other telephone number(s) as VNE may provide to Converge from time to time, or (2) via electronic mail to support.solutions@verticalnet.com, or such other e-mail address(es) as VNE may provide to Converge from time to time, or (3) in person to VNE Service Personnel (if any) on Converge premises at the time; provided, however, that the Converge Support Personnel shall communicate all Severity Level 1 and Severity Level 2\n\n\n\n\n\nProblems to VNE via method (1) or method (3) above. Converge shall classify all Problems reported to VNE according to the Problem Severity Levels listed in Exhibit A attached hereto.\n\n            2.4 Support Responsibilities. Converge and the Converge Support Personnel shall be responsible for providing Level 1 (help desk-type support) support to both Converge personnel (internal help desk) and Converge users (external help desk), for each of the Supported Products on which VNE has provided training as set forth in Section 3.3 below. Subject to the provisions of this Section 2, VNE shall be responsible for providing Level 2 (responding to technical inquiries) and Level 3 (code fixes) support for such Supported Products. In the case of Supported Products for which Converge is providing Level 1 support, Converge shall not escalate Problem Reports or Support Requests to VNE until such Problem Reports or Support Requests have been reasonably escalated through the Level 1 support procedures of Converge. In addition, Converge shall conduct reasonable problem identification and isolation activities to determine whether or not a given problem relates to the Products (i.e., whether a Problem as defined exists). Converge shall not escalate Problem Reports or Support Requests to VNE prior to conducting such activities or if Converge has determined that the Problem Report or Support Request does not relate to the Supported Products.\n\n            2.5 Additional Information for Problems. With respect to each Problem reported to VNE, Converge shall provide, at the time the Problem Report is communicated to VNE and to the extent known to or reasonably ascertainable by Converge, information that will enable VNE to reproduce (in as complete a step-by-step manner as is reasonably possible), or verify the existence of the Problem, plus any additional information regarding the Problem that Converge believes will assist in the diagnosis thereof and response thereto. The parties shall reasonably cooperate to obtain and provide to VNE any additional information about the reported Problem that may be relevant to diagnosing and responding thereto. In the event that Converge is unable to make a determination based on the problem identification and isolation activities described in Section 2.4 or reproduce, or provide the information necessary for VNE to diagnose or reproduce, any Problem, Converge may request VNE's assistance in performing identification and isolation or reproducing the Problem and/or generating or documenting such information.\n\n                                        4\n\n            2.6 Response to Problem Reports. VNE shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide Converge with an initial response to and status reports for all Problems reported by Converge, and to resolve all Problems identified, in accordance with the provisions of Exhibit B attached hereto; provided, however, that VNE shall have no further obligation to respond to or attempt to diagnose or resolve a Problem once it is determined not to be attributable to Errors. VNE will review all Problem Requests submitted by Converge at the Problem Severity Level indicated by Converge unless another Problem Severity Level is clearly warranted. In the event of a reasonable uncertainty, the parties will assume a higher Severity Level for a Problem until they have sufficient information to make a determination that a lower Severity Level is warranted. If, at Converge's request, VNE responds to a Problem at a Severity Level that is higher than what proves to be the actual Severity Level of the Problem, or if VNE's review of a Problem reported by Converge establishes that the Problem was not due to an Error, Converge shall pay or reimburse VNE for all incremental fees and expenses reasonably incurred by VNE in performing such activities.\n\n            2.7 Response to Support Requests. VNE shall respond to all Support Requests submitted by Converge within a reasonable period of time, taking into consideration the nature of the Support Request, its impact on Converge's business operations and any Problem Reports or other Support Requests VNE is responding to at such time.\n\n            2.8 Tracking Procedures. VNE will maintain procedures and systems designed to ensure that Problem Reports and Support Requests submitted by Converge are properly logged and tracked. In addition, VNE will provide to Converge a weekly status log of Problem Reports and Support Requests currently being tracked. Such report shall identify, as appropriate, each Problem Report or Support Request as submitted by Converge, the Severity Level for each identified Problem, the date and time each Problem Report or Support Request was received by VNE, an assessment of the Problem Report or Support Request and an action plan detailing the proposed method of resolution, and an estimated time schedule for delivery of any necessary Error corrections.\n\n            2.9 Remote Access. Converge shall provide VNE with remote access, via modem, the Internet or some other remote communications method mutually agreed-upon by the parties and subject to Converge's network security procedures and requirements, to Converge's servers on which the Supported Products are installed for the sole and limited purpose of enabling VNE to fulfill its obligation to provide Maintenance and Support Services hereunder. Converge shall be responsible for all costs associated with providing data network connectivity at the point of connectivity to Converge's data network. The parties will share equally in the cost of such connectivity between VNE's facilities and Converge's facilities (including all associated telecommunications charges). VNE shall not be responsible for any delay in providing Maintenance and Support Services under this Agreement to the extent such delay is due to Converge's adoption of unreasonable network security procedures or requirements.\n\n            2.10 Provision of Maintenance Updates. VNE shall provide Converge with Maintenance Updates as VNE makes them generally available to its other customers. Converge agrees to install in the recommend environments all Maintenance Updates within a reasonable time following the date they are provided by VNE, taking into consideration any testing and customization required by Converge (the parties expect that the time for such installation\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        5\n\ngenerally will not exceed 90 days). Should Converge find one or more material deficiencies in any Maintenance Update, Converge shall promptly identify such deficiencies to VNE in reasonable detail.\n\n            2.11 Method of Delivery. VNE will transfer to Converge all Maintenance Updates, and any associated Documentation, by remote telecommunications from the VNE place of business, to a Converge computer located at a Converge place of business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, if any. If any such Maintenance Update and/or associated Documentation cannot be delivered via remote telecommunications to a Converge computer located at a Converge place of business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, such Maintenance Update and/or Documentation will be installed by VNE on a Converge computer located at a Converge place of business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, if any. Converge will not obtain title or possession of any tangible personal property, including any storage media, as a result of the delivery of any Maintenance Update or associated Documentation under this Agreement.\n\n            2.12 Acceptance. Each Maintenance Update will be deemed accepted by Converge upon Converge's receipt of the complete delivery thereof to a Converge computer located at a Converge place of business.\n\n            2.13 License Rights. The scope of Converge's license rights to all Maintenance Updates shall be as set forth in the Subscription License Agreement. Except as may be set forth in the Subscription License Agreement, Converge acknowledges and agrees that Vert has no obligation to deliver Source Code for any Maintenance Update, or to grant Converge any license to use the Source Code form of any Maintenance Update.\n\n            2.14 Tracking of Maintenance Updates. VNE will maintain procedures and systems designed to ensure that all Maintenance Updates are compatible with previous versions of the Supported Products and any previously provided Maintenance Updates and Enhancements.\n\n            2.15 Modifications by Converge. Converge may notify VNE at least 10 Business Days in advance, through the Problem reporting process above, of Converge's desire to modify any Supported Product, or the hardware and other application and system software environment for any Supported Product. Within 10 Business Days of VNE's receipt of Converge's written notice, VNE will provide Converge with any recommendations that VNE may have as to how Converge should implement the desired modification. VNE shall have no responsibility for any Problems, Errors or other issues with respect to the Supported Products that are due to Converge's failure to ask for or follow any such recommendations of VNE.\n\n      3. Professional Services.\n\n            3.1 Project Managers. Each of Converge and VNE shall appoint a Project Manager to coordinate such party's activities with respect to the Professional Services hereunder. The initial VNE Project Manager shall be Michael Decker and the initial Converge Project Manager shall be Farooq Ahmad. Either party may change its Project Manager on notice (via e-mail or in some other reasonable fashion not necessarily in accordance with the express notice\n\n                                        6\n\nprovisions of this Agreement) to the other party's Project Manager and Relationship Manager at any time.\n\n            3.2 Monthly Work Plans. As reasonably requested by either party, the Converge Project Manager and the VNE Project Manager will conduct planning meetings to determine the Professional Services that VNE will provide to Converge for each month during the Term. In connection with each such planning meeting, the Converge Project Manager and the VNE Project Manager will jointly prepare a written work summary or plan (each, a Work Plan) indicating the Professional Services to be performed by VNE for such month. The Work Plan shall identify those Professional Services that the Project Managers anticipate can be performed without causing VNE to materially exceed (on a pro-rata monthly basis for the given quarter, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing) the Quarterly Allocation for any quarter during the Term. All Professional Services that the Project Managers anticipate will cause VNE to materially exceed (on a pro-rata monthly basis for the given quarter, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing) the Quarterly Allocation shall either be separately identified in the applicable Work Plan or performed by VNE pursuant to a Statement of Work prepared in accordance with the following provisions of this Section 3. The Converge Project Manager and the VNE Project Manager may amend any Work Plan upon their written agreement at any time.\n\n            3.3 Training to Converge. VNE will provide, and the Work Plans will encompass as appropriate, VNE providing reasonable training and available training materials to enable Converge to provide Level 1 support for the Supported Products (Support Training). Support Training will include both introductory training reasonably in advance of when new Supported Products are put into production by Converge and periodic refreshers as appropriate when Maintenance Updates and Vert-General Release Enhancements are released. Support Training will be provided at mutually agreed locations and times.\n\n            3.4 Environment and Deployment Process. As part of the Professional Services provided by VNE, VNE will create a document entitled, Environment and Deployment Process. This document will detail the recommended Supported Product environments and the build and deployment process for the Supported Products.\n\n\n\n\n\nVNE agrees to complete a draft of this document for Converge's review within 30 days following the Effective Date. Converge agrees to review and provide final comments on this draft document within 30 days after receipt thereof. Both parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to reach a mutual agreement on the document and execute the final document within 90 days following the Effective Date.\n\n            3.5 Initial Request and Response. If Converge desires that VNE perform any Professional Services that the Project Managers anticipate would cause VNE to materially exceed (on a pro-rata monthly basis for the given quarter, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing) the Quarterly Allocation, Converge shall submit to VNE a written request for such Professional Services, which request shall detail the Professional Services being requested in reasonable detail. Within 45 days after VNE's receipt of Converge's request for VNE to perform any such Professional Services, VNE shall furnish to Converge a preliminary statement of work (including proposed pricing, which shall take into account any portion of such work that will be covered by a portion of the Quarterly Allocation) under which VNE would be willing to perform such Professional Services for Converge (each, a Proposed SOW). VNE may respond to\n\n                                        7\n\nseparate requests for Professional Services in a single Proposed SOW; provided, however, that the Proposed SOW will itemize the foregoing information separately for each of the requested Professional Services.\n\n            3.6 Finalization of Proposed SOWs. If Converge desires to have VNE provide any Professional Services under the terms of a Proposed SOW, Converge shall notify VNE thereof in writing. Should Converge wish to negotiate the terms of the Proposed SOW, the Converge Project Manager and the VNE Project Manager shall promptly and in good faith discuss and agree upon what revisions, if any, should be made to the Proposed SOW. Should the Converge Project Manager and the VNE Project Manager reach mutual agreement on such revisions, if any, the Proposed SOW shall be finalized and executed by both parties in writing (each, a Final SOW).\n\n            3.7 Change Orders. Either party may request changes to a previously agreed upon Final SOW. In such event, VNE will inform Converge the impact of such changes. Changes to any Final SOW will be specified in a written change order or amendment to the Final SOW. Neither party shall be bound by any change order or amendment to a Final SOW unless and until such change order or amendment has been executed by both parties in writing.\n\n            3.8 Implementation. VNE will use commercially reasonable efforts to perform all Professional Services covered by a Work Plan or Final SOW in accordance with the schedule for performance of such Services set forth therein (or within a reasonable time, with due regard for the consequences of delayed performance, if no such schedule is set forth). Converge will reasonably cooperate with VNE in connection with its performance of such Professional Services as specified in the corresponding Work Plan or Final SOW and as may otherwise be reasonably requested by VNE. VNE shall not be liable for any default or delay in performance of such Professional Services to the extent the same is attributable to the failure of Converge to comply in any material respect with its obligations under this Agreement or any Work Plan or Final SOW.\n\n            3.9 Method of Delivery. VNE will transfer to Converge all Converge-Requested Enhancements to Converge, and any associated&bbsp;Documentation, by remote telecommunications from the VNE place of business, to a Converge computer located at a Converge place of business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, if any. If any such Converge-Requested Enhancement and/or associated Documentation cannot be delivered via remote telecommunications to a Converge computer located at a Converge place of business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, such Enhancement and/or Documentation will be installed by VNE on a Converge computer located at a Converge place of business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, if any. Converge will not obtain title or possession of any tangible personal property, including any storage media, as a result of the delivery of any Converge-Requested Enhancement or associated Documentation under this Agreement.\n\n            3.10 Acceptance. Each Converge-Requested Enhancement provided to Converge under a Final SOW will be subject to acceptance testing by Converge in accordance with the provisions of its corresponding Final SOW. All other Converge-Requested Enhancements provided to Converge under this Agreement will be deemed accepted by\n\n                                        8\n\nConverge upon Converge's receipt of the complete delivery thereof to a Converge computer located at a Converge place of business.\n\n            3.11 Ownership; License to Vert. Unless otherwise expressly stated in an applicable Work Plan or Final SOW, Vert shall be the sole and exclusive owner of all Converge-Requested Enhancements, but excluding any portions thereof that are or were developed independently by Converge or its Affiliates (Converge-Independent Materials) and any portions thereof that are Converge Brand Features or Third-Party Materials. Except as the parties may otherwise agree in writing, Converge, to the extent it has the legal right to do so, hereby grants to Vert an irrevocable, perpetual, world-wide, non-exclusive right and license to use, load, store, transmit, execute, copy, market, distribute, in any medium or distribution technology whatsoever, known or unknown, display, perform and sublicense the Converge-Independent Materials and the Third-Party Materials, in both Source Code and Object Code formats, and to make unlimited\n\n\n\n\n\ninstantiations thereof, for any and all purposes.

The scope of Converge's license rights to each Converge-Requested Enhancement shall be as set forth in the Subscription License Agreement and, if relevant, the applicable Final SOW. Except as may be set forth in the Subscription License Agreement or as the parties may otherwise expressly agree in writing, Converge acknowledges and agrees that Vert has no obligation to deliver Source Code for any Converge-Requested Enhancement, or to grant Converge any license to use the Source Code form of any Converge-Requested Enhancement.\n\n            3.13 Installation and Configuration. Converge shall be responsible for installing and configuring any Converge-Requested Enhancements provided by VNE hereunder. Converge may request, and VNE will provide, reasonable assistance to Converge in its efforts to install and configure such Enhancements as part of the Professional Services provided hereunder.\n\n            3.14 Third-Party Technology. Except as the parties may otherwise expressly agree in writing, Converge shall be responsible for paying for and, with VNE's assistance, securing license rights to any third-party technology required for the provision or use of any Converge-Requested Enhancements provided under this Agreement. Vert shall use reasonable efforts to identify to Converge all required license rights to third-party technology in the applicable Work Plan or Final SOW.\n\n            3.15 Unforseen Costs and Expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3, neither party shall be obligated to incur any costs or expenses in connection with the performance or implementation of a Work Plan or Final SOW unless such Work Plan or Final SOW reasonably contemplates that such party shall be responsible for such costs or expenses, or such party otherwise agrees in writing to incur such costs and expenses.\n\n                                        9\n\n            3.16 Escalation Procedures. Should the Converge Project Manager and the VNE Project Manager be unable to reach agreement on any matter within the scope of their discretion under this Section 3, the matter shall be escalated to the parties' respective Relationship Managers for discussion. In addition, should either party believe that the other party has failed to fulfill its obligations under Section 2 or this Section 3 above, the matter shall be escalated to the parties' respective Relationship Managers for discussion. The initial VNE Relationship Manager shall be William Swank and the initial Converge Relationship Manager shall be Francesco DeMarchis. Either party may change its Relationship Manager on notice (via e-mail or in some other reasonable fashion not necessarily in accordance with the express notice provisions of this Agreement) to the other party's Project Manager and Relationship Manager at any time, except that the Relationship Manager always shall be at the director level or higher.\n\n      4. Fees and Payments.\n\n            4.1 Minimum Fee During Initial Term. Converge shall pay to VNE a minimum fee of Four and One-Half Million Dollars ($4,500,000) for VNE's provision of the Services during the Initial Term (the Initial Term Minimum Fee). Converge shall pay the Initial Term Minimum Fee to VNE in 18 equal installments of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) (each, a Monthly Installment). Converge shall pay the first such Monthly Installment to VNE on the date this Agreement is executed and delivered by both parties. Thereafter, Converge shall pay each such Monthly Installment to VNE no later than the first day of each month during the Initial Term (November 2001 and through March 2003). All such Monthly Installments are non-refundable.\n\n            4.2 Minimum Fee During Each Renewal Term. If the Parties mutually agree in writing to renew this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1, the minimum fee payable by Converge to VNE during any such renewal period shall be as mutually determined by the Parties.\n\n            4.3 Application of Quarterly Allocation; Out-Of-Scope Services. For each quarter during the Term of this Agreement that Converge pays the applicable Monthly Installments, Converge shall be entitled to receive Services in an amount equal to the Quarterly Allocation; provided, however, that VNE shall provide all Maintenance and Support Services with respect to Problem Reports (but not with respect to Support Requests) reported during such quarter, and all Maintenance Updates released by VNE during such quarter, regardless of whether the provision of such Services would cause VNE to exceed the Quarterly Allocation for such quarter; and provided further, however, that if Converge fails to make a Monthly Installment when due (subject to the cure period in Section 9.2(c)), VNE shall not be required to provided additional Services during the remaining portion of the applicable quarter until such payment is made. Should Converge request and VNE provide any Professional Services, or any Maintenance and Support Services with respect to Support Requests, that would cause VNE to exceed the Quarterly Allocation for any quarter, then Converge shall pay VNE's then-current time charges, or such other charges as the parties may otherwise agree in any Final SOW (Out-Of-Scope Services), for such Out-Of-Scope Services. VNE shall use commercially reasonable efforts to inform Converge that any Professional Services requested by Converge would be Out-Of-Scope Services prior to VNE's performance of such Professional Services.\n\n\n\n\n\nConverge shall not be required to pay for and VNS shall not be required to perform any such Services that have not been approved in a Work Plan or Final SOW, or otherwise approved by Converge in writing.\n\n                                       10\n\n            4.4 Materials Costs and Expenses. Converge will reimburse VNE for all reasonable materials costs and expenses actually incurred by VNE in providing the Services under this Agreement, including travel and related expenses; provided, however, that VNE shall bear any travel or related expenses incurred by VNE at its sole option or as may be required in connection with the correction of any Error. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if travel is required due to the unavailability of remote access (see Section 2.9), then Converge shall reimburse VNE for the reasonable costs of such travel and related expenses. Upon Converge's request, the parties shall prepare budgets of any materials costs and expenses to be incurred by VNE in its performance of any Professional Services hereunder and any costs or expenses in excess of the applicable budgeted amounts shall be subject to Converge's written approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. VNE's invoices for all travel and related expenses shall be reasonably itemized and list all such expenses by category/person/trip, and be accompanied by reasonable documentation sufficient to support the deductibility by Converge of the reimbursable expense.\n\n            4.5 Invoicing and Payments. Converge shall pay the Monthly Installments to VNE on the dates specified in Section 4.1 and, if applicable, Section 4.2 above. All other amounts due under this Agreement will be invoiced by VNE to Converge on a monthly basis in arrears. All such invoiced amounts shall be due to VNE within 30 days following Converge's receipt of VNE's invoice. All payments will be made by Converge in U.S. dollars, without setoff, recoupment or deduction. All fees and other amounts not paid when due shall be subject to late charges of the lesser of (a) 1.5% per month of the overdue amount or (b) the maximum permitted under applicable law.\n\n            4.6 Taxes. The fees and other payments specified in this Agreement are exclusive of any sales, use and other taxes on consumption of goods and services (Sales Taxes), however designated or levied, based on this Agreement, delivery of the Services under this Agreement, or Converge's or its Affiliates' use thereof. In those jurisdictions in which VNE determines it is required to register, collect and remit Sales Taxes, VNE will separately invoice Converge for such Sales Taxes (which invoices shall be payable by Converge as set forth in Section 4.5), collect such Sales Taxes from Converge and remit such Sales Taxes to the proper taxing authority. In those jurisdictions in which VNE has determined that it does not have a collection responsibility, Converge will be required to self-assess and remit any Sales Taxes due on the purchase of taxable property and services acquired under this Agreement. Converge will retain ultimate responsibility and liability for remitting any Sales Taxes due on the purchase of any property and/or services acquired under this Agreement, including, without limitation, any interest, penalties or additions attributable to or imposed on or with respect to any such assessment excluding any taxes imposed upon the net income of either party). Subject to the express provisions of this Agreement, the parties will cooperate and use their commercially reasonable efforts to minimize or avoid, to the maximum extent allowed by law, the obligation to pay any Sales Taxes that may be levied on payments made under this Agreement or otherwise are chargeable by any applicable government authority with respect to the Services.\n\n            4.7 Tax Withholding. If laws, rules or regulations require withholding of any taxes imposed upon amounts payable to a party hereunder, the other party shall make such withholding payments as required and subtract such withholding payments from the amounts payable to such party. The other party shall submit reasonable proof of payment of the\n\n                                       11\n\nwithholding taxes to such party within 30 days after obtaining such proof. The parties agree to fully cooperate with each other, including, without limitation, in the filing of appropriate certificates of tax exemption, to ensure that any withholding payments required to be made by the other party are reduced or avoided to the fullest extent permitted by law. Converge shall be deemed to be the sole payor of payments owed to VNE under this Agreement and shall not have the right to substitute any domestic or foreign affiliate for that purpose, and if Converge reincorporates or otherwise reorganizes as a foreign person that would thereupon cause payments hereunder to VNE to become subject to withholding, then Converge shall comply with applicable laws to the extent required and shall gross up the payments otherwise owed to VNE so that VNE receives, net of withholding taxes, the amounts VNE would have received if Converge had not substituted a foreign person or had remained a domestic person.\n\n      5. Warranty.\n\n            5.1 Services Warranty. VNE warrants that the Services provided hereunder will be provided in accordance with generally-accepted industry standards applicable to the performance of services of a similar nature. In the event of any breach of the foregoing warranty, and provided that Converge reports such breach to VNE in writing within 90 days following the date of performance of the Services in question, VNE shall, as its sole obligation and Converge's sole and exclusive remedy, promptly repair, replace or re-perform the Services in question, without additional cost to Converge, so as to correct the warranty non-compliance as promptly as practicable (within 30 days to the extent technically feasible).\n\n            5.2 Disclaimer. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE EXPRESS WARRANTY PROVIDED\n\n\n\n\n\nIN SECTION 5.1 AND AS THE PARTIES MAY OTHERWISE AGREE IN ANY WORK PLAN, VNI AND ALL AFFILIATES OF VNI SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, ACCURACY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS RELATING TO ANY SERVICES, MAINTENANCE UPDATES OR ENHANCEMENTS PROVIDED OR TO BE PROVIDED HEREUNDER.\n\n      6. Limitation of Liability.\n\n            6.1 Disclaimer of Liability for Certain Damages.\n\n                  6.1.1 Consequential and Similar Damages. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE OR OBLIGATED IN ANY MANNER FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOST PROFITS, REVENUES OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES) HOWEVER CAUSED AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE PARTY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE. The foregoing limitation\n\n                                       12\n\nis independent of any exclusive remedies available to either party under this Agreement, including any failure of such remedies.\n\n                  6.1.2 Loss of Data, Usage, Etc. VERT DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT ANY MAINTENANCE UPDATES OR ENHANCEMENTS WILL OPERATE WITHOUT ERROR OR INTERRUPTION AND VERT SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH LOSS OF DATA OR INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF USE OF ANY PRODUCTS, MAINTENANCE UPDATES OR ENHANCEMENTS RESULTING THEREFROM.\n\n            6.2 Sole Remedy. IF A CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO ANY MAINTENANCE UPDATE, ENHANCEMENT OR SERVICES PROVIDED OR TO BE PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE REMEDIES SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, TO THE EXCLUSION OF THE REMEDIES SET FORTH IN THE SUBSCRIPTION LICENSE AGREEMENT, SHALL CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO A PARTY FOR SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION. IF A CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A PRODUCT OR ANY SERVICES PROVIDED UNDER THE SUBSCRIPTION LICENSE AGREEMENT, THE REMEDIES SET FORTH IN THE SUBSCRIPTION LICENSE AGREEMENT, TO THE EXCLUSION OF THE REMEDIES SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, SHALL CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO A PARTY FOR SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION. For the sake of clarity, the parties acknowledge that claims concerning Vert's ownership of and Converge's license rights to any Maintenance Updates, Enhancements or associated Documentation shall be deemed to have arisen under the Subscription License Agreement, that claims with respect to VNE's delivery of any Vert-General Release Enhancements or associated Documentation, or the performance or non-performance of any Vert-General Release Enhancements, shall be deemed to have arisen under the Subscription License Agreement, and that claims with respect to VNE's delivery of any Maintenance Updates, Converge-Requested Enhancements or associated Documentation, or the performance or non-performance of any Maintenance Updates or Converge-Requested Enhancements, shall be deemed to have arisen under this Agreement. NO LIABILITY SHALL EXTEND UNDER THIS AGREEMENT TO ANY THIRD PARTY (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY AFFILIATES OF VNI OTHER THAN VNE, OR THEIR LICENSORS) IF NOT INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OR DELIVERY OF ANY MAINTENANCE UPDATE, ENHANCEMENT OR SERVICES HEREUNDER.\n\n            6.3 Maximum Aggregate Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF EACH PARTY TO THE OTHER OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR DAMAGES, IF ANY, RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY MAINTENANCE UPDATE, ENHANCEMENT OR SERVICES PROVIDED OR TO BE PROVIDED HEREUNDER, WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT OR WARRANTY, STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER TORT, STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY, THE FAILURE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY TO ACHIEVE ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL NOT EXCEED (I) WITH RESPECT TO ANY ENHANCEMENT PROVIDED HEREUNDER, THE AMOUNTS PAID BY CONVERGE TO VERT FOR SUCH ENHANCEMENT, AND (II) WITH RESPECT TO ANY MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT SERVICES, THE AMOUNTS PAID BY\n\n                                       13\n\nCONVERGE TO VERT FOR SUCH MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT SERVICES DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH THE CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION FOR ANY SUCH DAMAGES FIRST AROSE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS ON EACH PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER SHALL BE IN ADDITION TO ANY FEES AND OTHER AMOUNTS DUE AND OWING UNDER SECTION 4. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION 6.3, THE TERM PARTY MEANS CONVERGE ON THE ONE HAND, AND VNI AND VNE COLLECTIVELY ON THE OTHER HAND, SO THAT AS TO VNI AND VNE THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 6.3 ARE COLLECTIVE LIMITATIONS AND NOT SEPARATE LIMITATIONS FOR EACH OF VNI AND VNE.\n\n            6.4 Exceptions. THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 6 SHALL NOT APPLY WITH RESPECT TO (A) ANY CLAIMS OF BODILY INJURY OR DAMAGE TO TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY RESULTING FROM WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE, (B) ANY BREACH OF THE CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS IN SECTION 7, OR (C) LIABILITY FOR PAYMENT OF INTEREST ADDED BY A COURT OF LAW OR AN ARBITRATION PANEL TO A JUDGMENT ENTERED IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n            6.5 Duty to Mitigate. Each party will have a duty to take reasonable steps to mitigate damages for which the other party is responsible.\n\n            6.6 Acknowledgement. Each of the parties acknowledge that the disclaimers and limitations set forth in this Section 6 are an essential element of this Agreement between the parties and that the parties would not have entered into this Agreement without such disclaimers and limitations.\n\n\n\n\n\n      7. Confidential Information.\n\n            7.1 Definition of Confidential Information. Confidential Information as used in this Agreement shall mean any and all proprietary or non-public information of a party whether in oral, written or other tangible form that the party disclosing the information (the Discloser) designates as being confidential or which, under the circumstances surrounding disclosure, the receiving party (the Recipient) knows or has reason to know should be treated as confidential.\n\n            7.2 Nondisclosure and Nonuse Obligations. Each of the parties, as Recipient, agrees that such Recipient will not use, disseminate, or in any way disclose any Confidential Information of the other party, as Discloser, to any person, firm or business, except to the extent necessary for the performance of such party's obligations or the enjoyment of such party's rights and benefits hereunder, and for any other purpose such Discloser may hereafter authorize in writing. Each of the parties, as Recipient, agrees that such Recipient shall treat all Confidential Information of the other party, as Discloser, with the same degree of care as such Recipient accords to such Recipient's own Confidential Information, but in no case less than reasonable care. Each of the parties, as Recipient, agrees&bbsp;that such Recipient shall disclose Confidential Information of the other party, as Discloser, only to those of such Recipient's employees who need to know such information, and such Recipient certifies that such Recipient employees have\n\n                                       14\n\npreviously agreed, either as a condition to employment or in order to obtain the Confidential Information of the Discloser, to be bound by terms and conditions substantially similar to those terms and conditions applicable to such Recipient under this Agreement. Each of the parties, as Recipient, shall immediately give notice to the other party, as Discloser, of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Discloser's Confidential Information. Each of the parties, as Recipient, agrees to assist the other party, as Discloser, in remedying any such unauthorized use or disclosure of Discloser's Confidential Information.\n\n            7.3 Exclusions from Nondisclosure and Nonuse Obligations. The obligations under this Section 7 of each of the parties, as Recipient, with respect to any portion of the Confidential Information of the other party, as Discloser, shall not apply to such portion that Recipient can document: (a) was in the public domain at or subsequent to the time such portion was communicated to Recipient by Discloser through no fault of Recipient; (b) was rightfully in Recipient's possession free of any obligation of confidence at or subsequent to the time such portion was communicated to Recipient by Discloser; (c) was developed by employees or agents of Recipient independently of and without reference to any information communicated to Recipient by Discloser; or (d) was communicated by Discloser to an unaffiliated third party free of any obligation of confidence. A disclosure by either of the parties, as Recipient, of Confidential Information of the other party, as Discloser, either (i) in response to a valid order by a court or other governmental body; (ii) as otherwise required by law; or (iii) as necessary to establish the rights of either party under this Agreement, shall not be considered to be a breach of this Agreement by Recipient or a waiver of confidentiality for other purposes; provided, however, that Recipient shall provide prompt prior written notice thereof to Discloser to enable Discloser to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent such disclosure.\n\n            7.4 Confidentiality of this Agreement. The parties hereto agree to keep the terms of this Agreement confidential and not to divulge any part thereof to any third party except: (a) with the prior written consent of the other party; (b) to any governmental body having jurisdiction to request and to read the same; (c) as otherwise may be required by law or legal process; or (d) to legal counsel representing either party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no disclosure of this Agreement shall be made pursuant to clauses (b) or (c) of the foregoing sentence without the disclosing party first giving the other party reasonable notice prior to the intended disclosure so as to allow the other party sufficient time to seek a protective order or otherwise assure the confidentiality of this Agreement as that other party shall deem appropriate. Each party agrees not to file this Agreement as an exhibit to its SEC filings without first redacting and requesting confidential treatment for any information reasonably considered by the other party to be confidential. Such other party shall inform the first party of any such information it wishes to redact and request confidential treatment for within five Business Days following the date such other party is requested to do so in writing. Nothing herein shall prohibit either party from complying with applicable securities or other laws, rules or regulations.\n\n      8. Non-Solicitation. During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of one year thereafter, Converge and Vert each agree not to directly or indirectly solicit, encourage or cause others to solicit or encourage any employees or individual independent contractors of the other party to terminate their employment or independent contracting relationship with the other party and become an employee or independent contractor of the soliciting party or its Affiliate. This provision does not prohibit a party's responding to unsolicited employment inquiries and/or any\n\n                                       15\n\nindirect solicitations and other employment activities (e.g., job postings, advertising of positions) that are not specifically targeted at any particular individual.\n\n\n\n\n\n      9. Term; Events of Default; and Termination.\n\n            9.1 Term. The initial period of this Agreement (the Initial Term) shall commence upon the Effective Date and continue until March 31, 2003. Thereafter, this Agreement shall renew only upon the mutual written agreement of the parties for up to three additional renewal terms of one year each (each, a Renewal Term). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.1, in the event any Services or other obligations of either party (including payment obligations) with respect to any Final Work Plan have not been completed or discharged as of the date on which this Agreement would otherwise expire, this Agreement shall remain in effect solely with respect to such Work Plan until such Services or other obligations have been completed or discharged.\n\n            9.2 Events of Default. The occurrence of any one or more of the following acts, events or occurrences shall constitute an Event of Default under this Agreement: (a) either party becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy or is subjected to involuntary bankruptcy proceedings that are not dismissed within 60 days, or makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (b) either party breaches any material provision of this Agreement and the result is the non-breaching party experiencing a substantial deprivation of the benefits to which the non-breaching party is entitled under this Agreement, which material breach is not cured by the breaching party within 30 days after the breaching party's receipt of the non-breaching party's written notice specifying the breach in detail; provided, however, that if the breach is of such a nature that it may be cured, but it may not reasonably be cured within such 30-day period, the non-breaching party may not terminate this Agreement unless such breach is not cured by the breaching party on or before the 60th day after the breaching party's receipt of the non-breaching party's notice of breach if breaching party has commenced substantial efforts to cure the breach within the initial 30-day period and has continued in good faith to work to cure the breach as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, or (c) Converge fails to pay when due any amounts payable under Section 4 and fails to cure such breach within 3 Business Days after VNE gives Converge written notice specifying the breach.\n\n            9.3 Termination. Immediately upon the occurrence of an Event of Default by either party, the other party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to terminate this Agreement, exercisable by such other party giving written notice thereof to first party within 10 Business Days after the occurrence of such Event of Default. In addition, this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon any termination of the Subscription License Agreement as permitted thereunder.\n\n            9.4 Effect of Termination. Upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement, each party shall erase, destroy or return to the other party all copies of the Confidential Information of or provided by such party under this Agreement and, upon such other party's written request, shall certify its compliance with this Section 9.4 to the other party in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.4, with respect to and for so long as any licenses granted to Converge respecting Deployed Products and/or Source Code under the Subscription License Agreement survive the expiration or termination of this\n\n                                       16\n\nAgreement, Converge shall not be required to erase, destroy or return any Confidential Information of Vert or its Affiliates respecting such Deployed Products and/or Source Code.\n\n            9.5 Effect of Vert Non-Renewal Election. If VNE or VNI is unwilling to renew this Agreement on its existing terms for any Renewal Term, a Vert Non-Renewal Election shall be deemed to have occurred. In the event of a Vert-Non-Renewal Election, in addition to any rights or remedies that may be available to Converge under the Subscription License Agreement, the provisions of Section 8 above shall cease to apply with respect to Converge's solicitation or encouragement of any of the VNE Service Personnel to terminate their employment or independent contracting relationship with VNE and become an employee or independent contractor of Converge or its Affiliate.\n\n            9.6 Effect of Converge Non-Renewal Election. If VNE or VNI is willing to renew this Agreement on its existing terms for any Renewal Term, but Converge elects not to renew this Agreement for any for any reason, a Converge Non-Renewal Election shall be deemed to have occurred. In the event of a Converge-Non-Renewal Election, the rights or remedies that may be available to Converge under the Subscription License Agreement, if any, shall apply.\n\n            9.7 Survival. Sections 3.11, 3.12, 4.1, 4.2, 4.6, 4.7, 5.2, 6, 7, 8, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7 and 10 shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement. In addition, all payment obligations under Section 5 that pertain to Services provided or otherwise accrue prior to the effective date of expiration or termination of this Agreement shall survive such expiration or termination.\n\n      10. General.\n\n            10.1 Notices. All notices permitted or required under this Agreement (Notices) shall be in writing and shall be delivered as follows with notice deemed given as indicated (a) by personal delivery when delivered personally; (b) by overnight courier upon written verification of receipt; or (c) by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, five days after deposit in the mail.

An effective waiver under this Agreement must be in writing signed by the party waiving its right. The failure of either party to require performance by the other party of any provision hereof shall not affect the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter; nor shall the waiver by either party of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of subsequent breaches of that or any other provision hereof.\n\n            10.4 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or be so held by applicable court decision, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and, in such event, such provision shall be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such provisions within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.\n\n            10.5 Headings. The section headings appearing in this Agreement are inserted only as a matter of convenience and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section or in any way affect such section.\n\n          &sbsp; 10.6 Choice of Law; Waiver of Jury Trial; Limitation of Action.

The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically excluded from application to this Agreement. The parties expressly waive any right to a jury trial regarding disputes related to this Agreement. Unless otherwise provided by local law without the possibility of contractual waiver or limitation, any legal or other action related to this Agreement must be commenced no later than two years from the date on which the cause of action arose.\n\n            10.7 No Agency.

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute\n\n                                       18\n\none and the same instrument. This Agreement shall become binding when any one or more counterparts hereof, individually or taken together, bear the signatures of both parties hereto.

A party may assign this Agreement to any Affiliate. Otherwise, neither party may assign this Agreement without the other party's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld). No transfer of this Agreement by operation of law or change in Control of a party, including, without limitation, by merger, consolidation or sale or other transfer of equity interests, shall be considered an assignment for purposes of this Section 11.9. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.\n\n            10.10 No Third-Party Beneficiaries.

This Agreement, together with the Subscription License Agreement and the other agreements referenced therein, are the entire agreement between Vert and Converge relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement shall supersede any prior agreement or\n\n\n\n\n\nunderstanding, whether written or oral, and any other communications between Vert and Converge relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.

The adverse impact of a             Severity 1 Problem on Converge's business is severe and immediate,             and requires an immediate solution. A Severity Level 1 Problem may             have one or more of the following characteristics, in each case             without Converge being able to implement a reasonable workaround:\n\n            -     Data is corrupted or lost by the Supported Product, or the                   Supported Product returns incorrect results, and such                   corruption, loss or incorrect results have a material adverse                   impact on critical or central functionality of the Supported                   Product             -     Complete or severe lack of ability to use the critical or                   central functionality of the Supported Product             -     The Supported Product crashes repeatedly             -     Critical or central functionality of the Supported Product is                   not operational or is severely degraded             -     Critical or central functionality of the Supported Product                   fails to run to completion\n\n2           A Severity Level 2 Problem is one where critical or central             functionality of the Supported Product is unavailable, or             performance of critical or central functionality of the Supported             Product is severely degraded, but in either such case Converge can             implement a reasonable workaround but such workaround does not             downgrade the Problem to Severity Level 3 or 4. Use of critical or             central functionality of the Supported Product can continue in a             restricted fashion through use of such workaround, but the user             still experiences a significant degradation of performance of such             functionality. A Severity Level 2 Problem may have one or more of             the characteristics of a Severity Level 1 Problem, but critical or             central functionality of\n\n            -     the Supported Product can continue to operate in a restricted                   fashion through use of such workaround.\n\n3           A Severity Level 3 Problem causes minimal interruption to             non-central or non-important functionality. The Problem has a minor             impact or is inconvenient. A Severity Level 3 Problem may have one             or more of the following characteristics:\n\n            -     Performance of the Supported Product is degraded in a                   non-critical manner             -     Performance of the Supported Product is minimally impaired\n\n\n\n\n\n                                       21\n\n          4           A Severity Level 4 Problem causes no loss of use of the Supported             Product. The following would be Severity Level 4 Problems:\n\n            -     Cosmetic problem with the Supported Product             -     Documentation error             -     Minor incorrect behavior of the Supported Product that does                   not impede its operation\n\n                                       22\n\n                                    Exhibit B                      Problem Response and Resolution Efforts\n\nSEVERITY        RESPONSE TIME AND STATUS REPORTS               RESOLUTION EFFORTS  LEVEL                                                              1            -   Initial Response (defined                -   Continuous efforts (24x7) with                     below) within 30 minutes after                 best available resources to                     the Problem is reported to VNE                 provide a workaround, patch,                     if the Problem is reported                     fix or other solution for the                     during Support Hours.

The founding of the palace dates back to the late 12th Century. It is situated about 500m from the location of the first officially settled Cathedral Church of the Diocese of Moray, in present-day Spynie Churchyard. For most of its occupied history, the castle was not described as a \"palace\"  this term first appeared in the Registry of Moray in a writ of 1524., The High Middle Ages or High Medieval Period was the period of European history around the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (c. 10011300). The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention end around 1500., Alexander I (medieval Gaelic: \"Alaxandair mac Maíl Coluim\"; modern Gaelic: \"Alasdair mac Mhaol Chaluim\"; c. 1078  23 April 1124), posthumously nicknamed The Fierce, was the King of Scotland from 1107 to his death., France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux., The Chaldean Catholic Church (\"dtha kaldetha qthuliqetha\"; Arabic:   \"al-Kansa al-kaldniyya\") is an Eastern Syriac particular church of the Catholic Church, under the Holy See of the Catholicos-Patriarch of Babylon, maintaining full communion with the Bishop of Rome and the rest of the Catholic Church. The Chaldean Catholic Church presently comprises around 500,000 people. Most Chaldo-Assyrians live in northern Iraq, with smaller numbers in adjacent areas in northeastern Syria, southeastern Turkey and northwestern Iran, a region roughly corresponding with what was Assyria between the 25th century BC and mid-7th century AD. There are also Chaldeans in the diaspora, primarily in the American states of Michigan, Illinois and California., David I or Dauíd mac Maíl Choluim (Modern: \"Daibhidh I mac [Mhaoil] Chaluim\";  24 May 1153) was a 12th-century ruler who was Prince of the Cumbrians (11131124) and later King of the Scots (11241153). The youngest son of Máel Coluim III (Malcolm III) and Margaret of Wessex, David spent most of his childhood in Scotland, but was exiled to England temporarily in 1093. Perhaps after 1100, he became a dependent at the court of King Henry I. There he was influenced by the Norman and Anglo-French culture of the court., Anagni is an ancient town and \"comune\" in Frosinone Province, Latium, central Italy, in the hills east-southeast of Rome. It is a historical center in Ciociaria., Edinburgh is the capital city of Scotland and one of its 32 local government council areas. Located in Lothian on the Firth of Forth's southern shore, it is Scotland's second most populous city and the seventh most populous in the United Kingdom. The 2014 official population estimates are 464,990 for the city of Edinburgh, 492,680 for the local authority area, and 1,339,380 for the city region as of 2014 (Edinburgh lies at the heart of the proposed Edinburgh and South East Scotland city region). Recognised as the capital of Scotland since at least the 15th century, Edinburgh is home to the Scottish Parliament and the seat of the monarchy in Scotland. The city is also the annual venue of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and home to national institutions such as the National Museum of Scotland, the National Library of Scotland and the Scottish National Gallery. It is the largest financial centre in the UK after London., The Bishop of Moray or Bishop of Elgin was the ecclesiastical head of the Diocese of Moray in northern Scotland, one of Scotland's 13 medieval bishoprics. If the foundation charter of the monastery at Scone is reliable, then the Bishopric of Moray was in existence as early as the reign of King Alexander I of Scotland (11071124), but was certainly in existence by 1127, when one Gregoir (\"Gregorius\") is mentioned as \"Bishop of Moray\" in a charter of king David I of Scotland. The bishopric had its seat at Elgin and Elgin Cathedral, but was severally at Birnie, Kinneddar and as late as Bishop Andreas de Moravia at Spynie, where the bishops continued to maintain a palace. The Bishopric's links with Rome ceased to exist after the Scottish Reformation, but continued, saving temporary abolition between 1638 and 1661, under the episcopal Church of Scotland until the Revolution of 1688. Episcopacy in the established church in Scotland was permanently abolished in 1689. The Bishops fortified seat for over 500 years was at Spynie Palace., The Battle of Bannockburn (\"Blàr Allt nam Bànag\", often mistakenly called \"Blàr Allt a' Bhonnaich\" in Scottish Gaelic) (24 June 1314) was a significant Scottish victory in the First War of Scottish Independence, and a landmark in Scottish history., Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \"head of government\" is often differentiated from the term \"head of state\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country., An archdeacon is a senior clergy position in the Syriac Orthodox Church, Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church, Anglican Communion, St Thomas Christians, Eastern Orthodox churches and some other Christian denominations, above that of most clergy and below a bishop. In the High Middle Ages it was the most senior diocesan position below a bishop in the Roman Catholic Church. An archdeacon is often responsible for administration within an archdeaconry, which is the principal subdivision of the diocese. The \"Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church\" has defined an archdeacon as \"A cleric having a defined administrative authority delegated to him by the bishop in the whole or part of the diocese.\" The office has often been described metaphorically as that of \"oculus episcopi\", the \"bishop's eye\"., The Diocese of Moray was one of the most important of the medieval dioceses in Scotland. \nHistory.\nIt was founded in the early years of the 12th century by David I of Scotland under its first bishop, Gregoir. It was suppressed in 1638 and never revived a s a titular see., Pope Boniface VIII (c. 1230  11 October 1303), born Benedetto Caetani, was Pope from 24 December 1294 to his death in 1303., Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \"lo Stivale\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state., Chancellor is a title of various official positions in the governments of many nations. The original chancellors were the \"cancellarii\" of Roman courts of justiceushers, who sat at the \"cancelli\" or lattice work screens of a basilica or law court, which separated the judge and counsel from the audience. A chancellor's office is called a chancellery or chancery. The word is now used in the titles of many various officers in all kinds of settings (government, education, religion, etc.). Nowadays the term is most often used to describe:\nHead of government.\nGermany.\nThe Chancellor of Germany or (official German title which means \"Federal Chancellor\"), is the title for the head of government in Germany. ' is the exclusively feminine form. In German politics the ' position is equivalent to that of a prime minister and is elected by the ', (\"Federal Diet\", the lower house of the German Federal Parliament), every four years on its first session after general elections. Between general elections, the Federal Chancellor (together with the whole cabinet) can only be removed from office by a ' (\"constructive motion of no confidence\") which consists in the candidacy of an opposition candidate for the office of Chancellor in the '. If this candidate gets a majority of the entire membership of the ', he (or she) will be sworn in immediately as new Federal Chancellor., Ciociaria is an area of Central Italy roughly corresponding to the province of Frosinone, but without a defined border nor historical identity. The name was adopted by a fascist movement of Frosinone as an ethnical denomination for the province of Frosinone, when it was created in 1927.\nIn the Middle Ages, this region was referred to as \"Campagna\". The local dialect, now known as \"ciociaro\", was earlier referred to as \"campanino\". In more recent times, the term \"Campagna Romana\", or Roman Campagna, a favorite subject of countless painters from all over Europe, has referred to the adjoining region to the north of \"Ciociaria\", but part of the Province of Rome., Andreas de Moravia (or Andrew of Moray) was a 13th-century Scottish bishop. He may have been from the \"de Moravia\" family of Flemish origin who were lords of Duffus and other areas in the Greater Moray region in this period. In the time of Bishop Bricius' episcopate (12031222), there was a man called \"Andreas\" who was rector of the church of St. Peter at Duffus, and this may well have been this Andreas. He may also have been a native Scot., Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides., The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments., Slovenia, officially the Republic of Slovenia (Slovene: , abbr.: \"RS\"), is a nation state in southern Central Europe, located at the crossroads of main European cultural and trade routes. It is bordered by Italy to the west, Austria to the north, Hungary to the northeast, Croatia to the south and southeast, and the Adriatic Sea to the southwest. It covers and has a population of 2.06 million. It is a parliamentary republic and a member of the United Nations, European Union, and NATO. The capital and largest city is Ljubljana., The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by some 337 million Europeans . Outside of Europe, a number of overseas territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency., The First War of Scottish Independence was the initial chapter of engagements in a series of warring periods between English and Scottish forces lasting from the invasion by England in 1296 until the \"de jure\" restoration of Scottish independence with the Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton in 1328. \"De facto\" independence was established in 1314 at the Battle of Bannockburn. England attempted to establish its authority over Scotland while the Scots fought to keep English rule and authority out of Scotland., Elgin Cathedral is a historic ruin in Elgin, Moray, north-east Scotland. The cathedraldedicated to the Holy Trinitywas established in 1224 on land granted by King Alexander II outside the burgh of Elgin and close to the River Lossie. It replaced the cathedral at Spynie, to the north, that was served by a small chapter of eight clerics. The new and bigger cathedral was staffed with 18 canons in 1226 and then increased to 23 by 1242. After a damaging fire in 1270, a rebuilding programme greatly enlarged the building. It was unaffected by the Wars of Scottish Independence but again suffered extensive fire damage in 1390 following an attack by Robert III's brother Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, also known as the Wolf of Badenoch. In 1402 the cathedral precinct again suffered an incendiary attack by the followers of the Lord of the Isles. The number of clerics required to staff the cathedral continued to grow, as did the number of craftsmen needed to maintain the buildings and surrounds. The number of canons had increased to 25 by the time of the Scottish Reformation in 1560, when the cathedral was abandoned and its services transferred to Elgin's parish church of St Giles. After the removal of the lead that waterproofed the roof in 1567, the cathedral steadily fell into decay. Its deterioration was arrested in the 19th century, by which time the building was in a substantially ruinous condition., San Marino, officially the Republic of San Marino, also known as the Most Serene Republic of San Marino, is an enclaved microstate surrounded by Italy, situated on the Italian Peninsula on the northeastern side of the Apennine Mountains. Its size is just over , with a population of 33,562. Its capital is the City of San Marino and its largest city is Dogana. San Marino has the smallest population of all the members of the Council of Europe., David de Moravia ( died 1326 ) was Bishop of Moray during most of the First War of Scottish Independence . He was elected Bishop of Moray , probably in early 1299 . Extended details exist regarding the election because of an extant letter of Pope Boniface VIII. The result of the election was that David had 13 votes , the Dean had 4 votes , the Chancellor had 3 votes and the Archdeacon 1 vote . The Dean declared that David was elected , and sent a request for confirmation to the Papacy . The latter found an irregularity , though what exactly this was was not revealed . The election result was nominally declared void , but the Pope himself provided David directly to the bishopric . He was consecrated as Bishop at Anagni in Italy on 28 June 1299 , by Matthew of Aquasparta , Cardinal - Bishop of Porto . In 1306 , King Edward I of England charged Bishop David with complicity in the murder of John III Comyn , Lord of Badenoch . David was excommunicated and fled to the Earldom of Orkney . King Edward sent a request to King Haakon V of Norway for Bishop David to be arrested . David escaped capture . On 17 June 1320 , the bishop was again excommunicated , by Pope John XXII , as an abettor of King Robert I of Scotland , enemy of King Edward II of England . On the orders of the Pope , the Bishop of Dunblane and the Bishop of Winchester delivered a sentence of excommunication on David and other bishops on 23 May 1322 . Bishop David is particularly notable as the founder of the Scots College in Paris in 1325 , by donating the land on which it was built . The foundation confirmed by Charles the Fair , King of the French , in August 1326 . Bishop David , however , died before the College was formally instituted . He died on 6 January 1326 , and was buried in the choir of Elgin Cathedral ., Vatican City , officially Vatican City State or the State of Vatican City, is a walled enclave within the city of Rome. With an area of approximately 44 hectares (110 acres), and a population of 842, it is the smallest State in the world by both area and population, but formally it is not sovereign, sovereignty being held by the Holy See, the only entity of public international law that has diplomatic relations with almost every country in the world., The pope (from \"pappas\", a child's word for \"father\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \"binding and loosing\", naming him as the \"rock\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI., Matthew of Aquasparta (Matteo di Aquasparta, 1240  29 October 1302) was an Italian Friar Minor and scholastic philosopher. He was elected Minister General of the Order., Subject: david de moravia, Relation: date_of_birth, Options: (A) 1 (B) 1001 (C) 1078 (D) 1093 (E) 110 (F) 1100 (G) 1107 (H) 1113 (I) 1124 (J) 1127 (K) 1153 (L) 1203 (M) 1222 (N) 1224 (O) 1230 (P) 1240 (Q) 1242 (R) 1296 (S) 1300 (T) 1302 (U) 1328 (V) 1402 (W) 1524 (X) 1567 (Y) 1638 (Z) 1661 ([) 1689 (\\) 18 (]) 19 (^) 1927 (_) 2 (`) 2013 (a) 23 (b) 24 june 1314 (c) 25 (d) 29 (e) 32 (f) 33 (g) 337 (h) 464 (i) 500 (j) 61 (k) 67 (l) 7 (m) 790\n\n### Response:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1300"}]}

It ended when metal tools became widespread (in the Copper Age or Bronze Age; or, in some geographical regions, in the Iron Age). The Neolithic is a progression of behavioral and cultural characteristics and changes, including the use of wild and domestic crops and of domesticated animals. \n\nThe beginning of the Neolithic culture is considered to be in the Levant (Jericho, modern-day West Bank) about 10,200 – 8,800 BC. It developed directly from the Epipaleolithic Natufian culture in the region, whose people pioneered the use of wild cereals, which then evolved into true farming. The Natufian period was between 12,000 and 10,200 BC, and the so-called \"proto-Neolithic\" is now included in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPNA) between 10,200 and 8,800 BC. As the Natufians had become dependent on wild cereals in their diet, and a sedentary way of life had begun among them, the climatic changes associated with the Younger Dryas are thought to have forced people to develop farming.\"\nOutput:\nWhat did Neolithic follow?\n\nInput:\n\"story\": \"Once upon a time in Greece, there lived a young man called Narcissus. He lived in a small village on the sea and was famous in the land because he was quite handsome. Villagers would turn up on the streets to stare at the beautiful child . When he grew up , people always said \"How handsome Narcissus is!\" Villagers thought that Narcissus could not be any more handsome than he already was. But as years passed Narcissus became a teenager. His beauty grew and became so great that he was known all over country of Greece. As he grew ,Narcissus was very proud of his good-looking face. \"Oh! You are so handsome ,Narcissus!\" Narcissus said one day as he looked into a pool.\"There's nobody more handsome in the whole world ! I'd love to kiss you . And that's just what I'll do!\" He leaned closer to the water . Suddenly he lost his balance and fell into the pool . Narcissus tried to reach the bank of the pool, but he could not swim and he drowned.\"\nOutput:\nWhere did he live?\n\nInput:\nEvery day Yang Hongwei takes the bus home from work, staring silently at the European-style villas , luxury cars and twinkling lights from the shopping center that he sees through the window. \n\nYang works for a software company in Zhongguancun. He dreams of such a life, away from poverty, and that hope has kept him in Beijing for three years since he graduated from university. \n\nSoon Yang squeezes his way off the bus to the reality of his life: his home--a 10-square-metre room that costs 550 yuan(81 US dollars) or about one-fifth of his salary in rent every month. It's very cold inside the house as it has no central heating system. He has to stand the long and cold winter. Determined to achieve his dream, Yang says he has changed jobs \"numerous\" times in the past three years and is considering quitting his present job. \n\nYang's frustration over his life as a migrant is shared by many other graduates that have moved into big cities. Together they have come to be called the \"ant tribe\", a term created by Chinese sociologists to describe the struggles of young migrants, who, armed with their diplomas, flood to big cities in hopes of a better life only to put up with low-paying jobs and poor living conditions. They share every similarity with ants. They live in colonies in crowded areas. They're intelligent and hardworking, yet unknown and underpaid. The term, sociologists have said, also reflects their helplessness in a world governed by the law of the concrete jungle--only the strongest survive. \n\nA survey in Ant TribeII found nearly 30 percent of the \"ants\" are graduates of famous key universities--almost three times the percentage of 2009. Most have degrees in popular majors, such as medicine, engineering, economics and management. In addition, 7.2 percent of the \"ants\" have at least a master's degree compared to 1.6 percent in 2009. Most said the economic recovery did not really improve their financial situations, and 66 percent said their incomes fell short of their expectations, the survey also found. \n\nFor two years, Lian Si, a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Chinese and Global Affairs of Peking University, who has studied the phenomenon, led a team of more than 100 graduate students to follow the groups in university towns like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan and Xi'an. Lian evaluates the total population of the \"ant community\" in major cities at one million across China, with about 100,000 found in Beijing alone. Lian predicts that an increasingly challenging job market will see the ant tribe growing further in number. Another 6.3 million graduates are expected to join migrant workers and other job hunters in what promises to be a fierce labour competition. \n\nThe ant tribe's embarrassing living situations have become a serious social issue, and the government should develop \"second-and-third-tier cities\" to attract more graduates from big cities. However, \"ants\" expect more study and training opportunities in big cities, which keeps them in positive mindsets despite their situations. As in the case of Yang, he is optimistic about getting a new job soon, having received eight interview offers in a week after sending out his resume. The prospect of landing a higher-paying job keeps him hopeful of moving out of the slum district soon. The sooner the better.\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Who is the article about?"}]}

Your task is to generate question for given answer based on set of context paragraphs, supporting facts and an answer.\n\nInput:\nContext_1 : Charles Edward Ives ( ; October 20, 1874May 19, 1954) was an American modernist composer. He is one of the first American composers of international renown, though his music was largely ignored during his life, and many of his works went unperformed for many years. Over time, he came to be regarded as an \"American original\". He combined the American popular and church-music traditions of his youth with European art music, and was among the first composers to engage in a systematic program of experimental music, with musical techniques including polytonality, polyrhythm, tone clusters, aleatory elements, and quarter tones, foreshadowing many musical innovations of the 20th century. Context_2 : Daniel Evan Freeman (born 27 April 1959) is an American musicologist who specializes in European art music of the eighteenth century, in particular the musical culture of eighteenth-century Prague and the Bohemian lands. He is also active as a pianist and music editor. Context_3 : Art music (also known as Western classical music, cultivated music, serious music, canonic music, and more flippantly, real music or normal music) is an umbrella term that refers to musical traditions, implying advanced structural and theoretical considerations and a written musical tradition. \"Serious\" or \"cultivated\" music are terms frequently used as a contrast for ordinary, everyday music (popular and folk music, also called \"vernacular music\"). After the 20th century, art music was divided into two extensions: \"serious music\" and \"light music\". Context_4 : In the history of European art music, the term \"common practice period\" refers to the era between the formation and the dissolution of the tonal system. Though there are no exact dates for this phenomenon, most features of the common-practice period persisted from the mid to late baroque period, through the Classical and Romantic periods, or roughly from around 1650 to 1900. While certain prevailing patterns and conventions characterize the music of this period, the time period also saw considerable stylistic evolution. Some conventions evolved during this period that were rarely employed at other times during what may still be labeled \"common practice\" (for example, Sonata Form). Thus, the dates 1650–1900 are necessarily nebulous and arbitrary borders that depend on context. The most important unifying feature through this time period concerns a harmonic language to which modern music theorists can apply Roman numeral analysis. Context_5 : The Festival Oude Muziek Utrecht (\"Utrecht Early Music Festival\") is an annual music festival that showcases and celebrates early European art music. The ten-day festival takes place in the Dutch city of Utrecht, and begins in August. The programme comprises concerts, activities, lectures, exhibitions, and a symposium. Context_6 : Assaf Shelleg (Hebrew: אסף שלג‎ ‎ ), is a musicologist and pianist, a senior lecturer of musicology at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He was previously the Schusterman Visiting Assistant Professor of Musicology and Jewish Studies in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Virginia (2011–14), and had taught prior to that as the visiting Efroymson Scholar in the Jewish, Islamic & Near Eastern Languages and Cultures Department at Washington University in St. Louis (2009–11). Shelleg specializes in twentieth-century Jewish and Israeli art music and has published in some of the leading journals in both musicology and Israel Studies on topics ranging from the historiography of modern Jewish art music to the theological networks of Israeli art music. Shelleg's book, \"Jewish Contiguities and the Soundtrack of Israeli History\", appeared in November 2014 with Oxford University Press. The book studies the emergence of modern Jewish art music in central and Western Europe (1910s-1930s) and its translocation to Palestine/Israel (1930s-1970s), exposing the legacies of European antisemitism and religious Judaism in the making of Israeli art music. Moving to consider the dislocation of modern Jewish art music the book examines the paradoxes embedded in a Zionist national culture whose rhetoric negated its pasts, only to mask process of hybridizations enchained by older legacies. \"Jewish Contiguities\" has won the 2015 Engle Prize for the study of Hebrew Music, and the 2016 Jordan Schnitzer Book Award. Context_7 : Vocal harmony is a style of vocal music in which a consonant note or notes are simultaneously sung as a main melody in a predominantly homophonic texture. Vocal harmonies are used in many subgenres of European art music, including Classical choral music and opera and in the popular styles from many Western cultures ranging from folk songs and musical theater pieces to rock ballads. In the simplest style of vocal harmony, the main vocal melody is supported by a single backup vocal line, either at a pitch which is above or below the main vocal line, often in thirds or sixths which fit in with the chord progression used in the song. In more complex vocal harmony arrangements, different backup singers may sing two or even three other notes at the same time as each of the main melody notes, mostly with consonant, pleasing-sounding thirds, sixths, and fifths (although dissonant notes may be used as short passing notes). Context_8 : David Wallis Reeves (February 14, 1838 – March 8, 1900), also known as D. W. Reeves or Wally Reeves, was an American composer, cornetist, and bandleader. He developed the American march style, later made famous by the likes of John Philip Sousa, and his innovations include adding a countermelody to the American march form in 1876. Sousa called Reeves \"The Father of Band Music in America\", and stated he wished he himself had written Reeves' \"Second Regiment Connecticut National Guard March\". Charles Ives also borrowed from the \"Second Connecticut\" on four occasions. Context_9 : \"Indian classical music is one of many forms of art music that have their roots in particular regional cultures. For other \"classical\" and art music traditions, see List of classical and art music traditions.\" Context_10 : Progressive music is music that subverts genre and expands stylistic boundaries outwards. Rooted in the idea of a cultural alternative, musical progressiveness embodies a continuous move between explicit and implicit references to genres and strategies derived from various cultural domains, such as European art music, Celtic folk, West Indian, or African. The word \"progressive\" comes from the basic concept of \"progress\", which refers to development and growth by accumulation, and is often deployed in numerous music genres such as progressive country, progressive folk, progressive jazz, and (most significantly) progressive rock. fact_1 :  Charles Ives also borrowed from the \"Second Connecticut\" on four occasions. fact_2 : Charles Edward Ives ( ; October 20, 1874May 19, 1954) was an American modernist composer. fact_3 :  He combined the American popular and church-music traditions of his youth with European art music, and was among the first composers to engage in a systematic program of experimental music, with musical techniques including polytonality, polyrhythm, tone clusters, aleatory elements, and quarter tones, foreshadowing many musical innovations of the 20th century.

A tribute to New Jersey's Palisades Amusement Park, it is an up-tempo rock and roll tune led by a distinctive organ part. The track also incorporates amusement park sound effects, including the sounds of screaming riders on the roller coasters, and the quoting of a slower version of the \"March of the Clowns\", played on an organ imitating a Hurdy Gurdy or Caliope. In the song, the singer takes a walk after dark and discovers Palisades Park, where he meets and falls in love with a girl. Among the list of rides and attractions listed in the song are: \"Shoot the Chute, Rocket Ship, Roller Coaster, Loop the Loop, Merry Go Round, Tunnel of Love, and the Ferris Wheel. Context_3 : William J. Dorgan (November 9, 1921 - October 11, 2003) was an American Republican Party politician who served in the New Jersey General Assembly, as Mayor of Palisades Park, New Jersey, and as a member of the Bergen County Board of Chosen Freeholders. Dorgan was born on November 9, 1921 in Cliffside Park, New Jersey, the son of William and Julia Dorgan. He graduated from St. Cecilia High School and attended Seton Hall University. Dorgan served for seven years as the Mayor of Palisades Park, and for three years as a Bergen County Freeholder. He was elected Assemblyman in 1969. He was not a candidate for re-election in 1971.

Context_10 : Luna Park was one of several names for an amusement park that existed in Rexford, New York, near Schenectady, from 1901 to 1933. In addition to Luna Park (the name given by developer/entrepreneur Frederick Ingersoll when he added rides and assumed control of Rexford Park in 1906), it was also known as Dolle's Park (named after Fred Dolle, who bought the park from Ingersoll in 1912), Colonnade Park, Palisades Park, and (again) Rexford Park (in 1916) before the rides were dismantled in 1933. Constructed around the Grand View Hotel (built and opened by Jacob Rupert in 1901), the park was similar to Ingersoll's other Luna Parks in which it was a trolley park with roller coasters, picnic pavilions, carousels, a fun house, a roller rink, a concert shell, a dance hall, a midway, a Whip, and a shoot-the-chutes ride which presented itself at the park entrance adjacent to a station of the Van Vranken electric trolley line. Roughly seven decades before the Skycoaster rides that now dot various United States amusement parks, Luna/Rexford Park featured an aerial swing ride. fact_1 : \"Palisades Park\" is a song written by Chuck Barris and recorded by Freddy Cannon. fact_2 :  Barris wrote an autobiography titled \"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\", which was made into the film of the same name directed by George Clooney.

Reports of the event were given in the Herald, and for the IAAF. Context_2 : The 2016–17 Formula E season was the third season of the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) Formula E motor racing. It featured the 2016–17 FIA Formula E Championship, a motor racing championship for open-wheel electric racing cars, recognised by FIA, the sport's governing body, as the highest class of competition for electrically powered vehicles. Twenty-five drivers representing ten teams contested twelve ePrix, starting in Hong Kong on 8 October 2016 and ending in Montreal on 30 July 2017 as they competed for the Drivers' and Teams' Championships. Context_3 : The 2017 Montreal ePrix (formally the 2017 FIA Formula E Hydro-Québec Montréal ePrix) were a pair of Formula E races held on 29 and 30 July 2017 at the Montreal Street Circuit in Montreal, Quebec before an two-day crowd of 45,000 people.

He returns her to the prison in secret. While changing back into prison clothes, Robin meets Billy Moran (Vincent Spano) a carpenter and handyman who is doing work in the compound under supervision that is supposed to keep him isolated from the female inmates. Billy helps Robin temporarily hide from the guards, and they have sex.Robin learns who James Tiernan is from a political ad on television where he talks about his strong stance on prison issues. She manages to call him at his campaign headquarters, asking for help on her upcoming parole hearing. James gives her advice, one suggestion of which is that she get married. Robin approaches Billy, offering him five thousand dollars to marry her for a year so she can get out of prison. Billy accepts, they are married and Robin is released not long after.Robin moves in with Billy, who also lives with his older brother Peter (Donovan Leitch) and Billy's unruly six-year-old son Timmy (Jamie McEnnan). Initially there is a clash of personalities due to the contrast between Billy's serious demeanor and Robin's wild-child nature. Billy is interested in having a real relationship with Robin, who instead insists that their marriage is just an arrangement, and that she wants to focus on her musical career. Robin starts up a band, which Peter joins, and also meets up again with James, who uses Robin as a poster child for successful prison reform on his campaign.Robin spends more time with the family, getting close to Peter and Timmy, which upsets Billy. Robin suggests they see other people, which Billy accepts. Billy has sex with another woman, while Robin has sex with James, who is married. Afterward the pair confront each other jealously over their being with other people.The next morning Robin reconciles with Billy, helping him out when his jeep breaks down and spending time with him at work restoring an old museum. They have sex in Billy's workshop, and are interrupted by a group of tourists, who take pictures of the pair. At first Robin's public indencency is hushed up due to her status as James' poster child, but when James sees the pictures he is jealous, and orders that Robin's parole be revoked. The police come for Robin when she is performing with her band at a bar. Robin flees to James' house for help, but he turns her away. Robin goes back to Billy's house, where he has packed up her things and prepared money for her. Billy promises to help her no matter what she wants to do, and Robin decides she's tired of running.Billy and Robin secretly crash James' political dinner. Robin takes to the stage with her band, praising James' assistance in \"helping\" her. Her passionate performance earns them a standing ovation, which in turn helps James' image.

John Cotton leads this bunch of \"misfits\" who are all, to varying degrees, emotionally or psychologically disturbed.  Cotton's group, composed of rejects and outcasts from the other cabins, is known as the \"Bedwetters\" and the boys are constantly demeaned and ridiculed, which inevitably crushes what little self-esteem they might otherwise have possessed in the first place.\nCotton, through trial and tribulation, becomes the leader of this tight-knit group, and he sets out to mold his followers into a unit that commands respect rather than derision. His is obviously a formidable task in view of the fragile psychological state of the small group, which includes two warring dysfunctional brothers who are known as \"Lally 1\" and \"Lally 2\". Lally 1 reacts to threats against his emotional security by throwing violent temper tantrums, often directed at his younger brother Lally 2, who in the face of these attacks plunges himself into a fantasy world that is filled with tiny creatures he calls \"Ooms\", and seeks solace in the scorched foam rubber pillow he always carries.\nLawrence Teft III is shown in the film as quiet and sullen, but whenever he is confronted with authority, he turns rebellious. Before he came to camp, one of Teft's favorite adventures had been stealing cars, but because of the \"connections\" of his father, Lawrence Teft Jr., he was never arrested for any of his offenses. Hoping that he will learn some self-discipline which will make him worthy of attending Exeter or Dartmouth, his parents enroll him in the camp.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Whose parents' send him to the Arizona Box Canyon Boys Camp in the hopes that he develops self-discipline?"}]}

The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command.

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n\nInput: The fact that Samoa could not qualify for the quarter-finals, whatever the result, meant that they were going to want to play more expansively and give their supporters something to cheer about, despite it being a disappointing World Cup campaign.\nThis made them dangerous - but also vulnerable.\nTo combat this, Scotland wanted to play a slightly more set-piece orientated game and hold possession, which they initially struggled to do.\nThe story of the first half was mainly about Samoa. They looked excited and enthused in attack, playing with width and subtlety and were throwing caution to the wind.\nThe width they were playing with often created mismatches - backs attacking forwards - on the edges of the defensive line.\nTim Nanai-Williams and Reynold Lee-lo were exceptional and regularly beat the first man. They were playing in a traditional Pacific Island style, not worrying too much about structure or exits - and this suited them.\nThe plus side for Scotland was that they looked dangerous when they had the ball too. Samoa's defence wasn't particularly structured.\nThey were there to put a show on in attack, but they were very keen to put the individual big hits in which can be very destructive when it comes off - but it can also create dog legs to exploit.\nA noticeable tactical call from Scotland was to turn down kicks at goal and kick to the corner instead.\nMy theory on this was that they were trying to starve Samoa of the ball, to make them defend and not give the ball back until they had an extra five or seven points. It also showed a real confidence in their line-out maul and ball retention.\nThe ironic thing was that they failed to score from the first set of drives and it was only once Scotland had Ryan Wilson sin-binned that they converted the maul into points.\nOne of Scotland's first-half issues, and a problem area for the whole World Cup, was kick-off receipt. Samoa won back their first three kick-offs, kicking short and up the middle.\nEven when Scotland put a 'pod' in that target area, Samoa regained the ball. It is an area that needs to be addressed because, as I've mentioned before, it's a real momentum killer.\nScotland decided to kick long with their kick-offs, pincering the Samoans deep in their 22m. I think this tactical decision was made as they knew Samoa were going to want to throw the ball around and was an area where they could build pressure.\nThe Scots had very good numbers in their front-line chase where normally there would be a more passive chase on the edges. This suggests it was a deliberate ploy and the pressure resulted in the Tommy Seymour try.\nScotland were probably fortunate to still be in the game at half-time, but they deserve credit for this and were clinical with their opportunities.\nSamoa seemed to self-combust just after half-time, giving away seven penalties in 15 minutes. It gave Scotland a foothold in the game, allowing them territory and possession. The match slowed down and, with that, the sting went out of the Samoan attack.\nScotland continued with turning down kickable penalties into the second half, but after a few efforts, they bore no fruit. Greig Laidlaw decided enough was enough and kicked the points.\nThere was a fairly crucial moment at 52 minutes, one that showed how important the rub of the green is.\nThe momentum was all with Scotland and, with the score at 26-26, Samoa kicked off.\nFinn Russell had his kick charged down deep in his own 22m. It could have ricocheted anywhere but in this instance dropped nicely into Wilson's hands and, after a 30m break, Scotland were awarded a penalty and it was 29-26.\nCritical to the victory was the decision to take the scrum in front of the posts at 73 minutes, a brave call that resulted in Laidlaw's try.\nIt's the process of the decision and previous decisions that was impressive. There were discussions, and decisions were made with clear heads, with a rationale behind them.\nThis is the sign of a strong leadership group. The game could have slipped away, but when Scotland needed to step it up, that's what they did.\n\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There were plenty of tactical elements to Scotland's pulsating 36-33 World Cup win over Samoa in Newcastle on Saturday."}]}

Your task is to generate the question for the answer based on the given article.\nArticle: We are not who we think we are. The American self-image is spread with the golden glow of opportunity. We think of the United States as a land of unlimited possibility, not so much a classless society but as a place where class is mutable--a place where brains, energy and ambition are what counts, not the circumstances of one's birth. The Economic Mobility Project, an ambitious research led by Pew Charitable Trusts, looked at the economic fortunes of a large group of families over time, comparing the income of parents in the late 1960s with the income of their children in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Here is the finding: \"The 'rags to riches' story is much more common in Hollywood than on Main Street. Only 6 percent of children born to parents with family income at the very bottom move to the top. That is right, just 6 percent of children born to parents who ranked in the bottom of the study sample, in terms of income, were able to bootstrap their way into the top . Meanwhile, an incredible 42 percent of children born into that lowest are still stuck at the bottom, having been unable to climb a single rung of the income ladder. It is noted that even in Britain---a nation we think of as burdened with a hidebound class system-children who are born poor have a better chance of moving up. When the studies were released, most reporters focused on the finding that African-Americans born to middle-class or upper middle-class families are earning slightly less, in inflation-adjusted dollars, than did their parents. One of the studies indicates, in fact, that most of the financial gains white families have made in the past three decades can be attributed to the entry of white women into the labor force. This is much less true for African-Americans. The picture that emerges from all the quintiles, correlations and percentages is of a nation in which, overall, \"the current generation of adults is better off than the previous one\", as one of the studies notes. The median income of the families in the sample group was $55,600 in the late 1960s; their children's median family income was measured at $71,900. However, this rising tide has not lifted all boats equally. The rich have seen far greater income gains than have the poor. Even more troubling is that our nation of America as the land of opportunity gets little support from the data. Americans move fairly easily up and down the middle rungs of the ladder, but there is \"stickiness at the ends\" --four out of ten children who are born poor will remain poor, and four out often who are born rich will stay rich. \n Answer: The rags to riches story is only true for a small minority of whites.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What did the Economic Mobility Project find in its research?"}]}

If a story is imagined, the person who wrote the story is making it up, pretending they experienced it. If a story is recalled, the person who wrote the story really experienced it and is recalling it from memory. If a story is retold, it is a real memory like the 'recalled' stories, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, recalled stories and retold stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer. Imagined stories have a more linear flow and contain more commonsense knowledge, whereas recalled stories are less connected and contain more specific concrete events. Additionally, higher levels of self reference are found in imagined stories. Between recalled and retold stories, retold stories flow significantly more linearly than recalled stories, and retold stories are significantly higher in scores for cognitive processes and positive tone.\n\nInput:\nMe and my girlfriend had gone to the Los Angeles Zoo. I can't exactly remember the day but I believe it was either April or May or maybe June. It was a hot day that day and it was spur of the moment trip. I honestly wasn't particularly excited to go but my girlfriend had been bugging me for months to go to the zoo so I finally said let's go. We got there around 10 or 11 in the morning and it was already around 90 degrees. When we walked in there was the insect/reptile section of the zoo so we saw many exotic looking spiders, snakes, scorpions etc. I liked it but my girlfriend didn't like insects. Then we walked in the African animals section. We saw elephants mostly and we could hear monkeys and apes in the distance somewhere. So we keep walking and eventually we find the apes. We saw gorillas hanging out in the shade and in a different section we saw other chimps and monkeys. We walked past that and we saw giraffes. Watching the giraffes was a cool site because they got really close to us. Like one of them was looking at me and came in my direction and I thought it would actually do something to me. Then after we saw the lions and they were mostly hanging out in the shade to stay out of the heat. We continued to walk around and we saw a section with Australian animals. So we managed to see koalas in the tress and tasmanian devils. I think we also saw kangaroos but I can't remember. We spent a lot of time at the zoo maybe around 5-6 hours. I think we left and we got back home around 4 or 5 pm.\nOutput:\nretold\n\nInput:\nFive months ago, my niece and nephew were born.

I will never forget holding the babies for the first time. My niece especially was tiny. They were both premature, but she was only 5 pounds. My nephew was a little bit bigger and seemed stronger. We were all so grateful that there were no complications or health issues, which I learned can be common with twins. They were both so perfect and tiny. I was like holding tiny dolls.

After having breakfast, we set out to observe the sin city. There were people everywhere. We were thrilled to see amazing structures such the water show at one of the hotels. We walked all day observing hotels and casinos and trying out various drinks. The night time was even more amazing with music and songs being played.

Your task is to generate question for given answer based on set of context paragraphs, supporting facts and an answer.\n\nInput:\nContext_1 : Charles Edward Ives ( ; October 20, 1874May 19, 1954) was an American modernist composer. He is one of the first American composers of international renown, though his music was largely ignored during his life, and many of his works went unperformed for many years. Over time, he came to be regarded as an \"American original\". He combined the American popular and church-music traditions of his youth with European art music, and was among the first composers to engage in a systematic program of experimental music, with musical techniques including polytonality, polyrhythm, tone clusters, aleatory elements, and quarter tones, foreshadowing many musical innovations of the 20th century. Context_2 : Daniel Evan Freeman (born 27 April 1959) is an American musicologist who specializes in European art music of the eighteenth century, in particular the musical culture of eighteenth-century Prague and the Bohemian lands. He is also active as a pianist and music editor. Context_3 : Art music (also known as Western classical music, cultivated music, serious music, canonic music, and more flippantly, real music or normal music) is an umbrella term that refers to musical traditions, implying advanced structural and theoretical considerations and a written musical tradition. \"Serious\" or \"cultivated\" music are terms frequently used as a contrast for ordinary, everyday music (popular and folk music, also called \"vernacular music\"). After the 20th century, art music was divided into two extensions: \"serious music\" and \"light music\". Context_4 : In the history of European art music, the term \"common practice period\" refers to the era between the formation and the dissolution of the tonal system. Though there are no exact dates for this phenomenon, most features of the common-practice period persisted from the mid to late baroque period, through the Classical and Romantic periods, or roughly from around 1650 to 1900. While certain prevailing patterns and conventions characterize the music of this period, the time period also saw considerable stylistic evolution. Some conventions evolved during this period that were rarely employed at other times during what may still be labeled \"common practice\" (for example, Sonata Form). Thus, the dates 1650–1900 are necessarily nebulous and arbitrary borders that depend on context. The most important unifying feature through this time period concerns a harmonic language to which modern music theorists can apply Roman numeral analysis. Context_5 : The Festival Oude Muziek Utrecht (\"Utrecht Early Music Festival\") is an annual music festival that showcases and celebrates early European art music. The ten-day festival takes place in the Dutch city of Utrecht, and begins in August. The programme comprises concerts, activities, lectures, exhibitions, and a symposium. Context_6 : Assaf Shelleg (Hebrew: אסף שלג‎ ‎ ), is a musicologist and pianist, a senior lecturer of musicology at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He was previously the Schusterman Visiting Assistant Professor of Musicology and Jewish Studies in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Virginia (2011–14), and had taught prior to that as the visiting Efroymson Scholar in the Jewish, Islamic & Near Eastern Languages and Cultures Department at Washington University in St. Louis (2009–11). Shelleg specializes in twentieth-century Jewish and Israeli art music and has published in some of the leading journals in both musicology and Israel Studies on topics ranging from the historiography of modern Jewish art music to the theological networks of Israeli art music. Shelleg's book, \"Jewish Contiguities and the Soundtrack of Israeli History\", appeared in November 2014 with Oxford University Press. The book studies the emergence of modern Jewish art music in central and Western Europe (1910s-1930s) and its translocation to Palestine/Israel (1930s-1970s), exposing the legacies of European antisemitism and religious Judaism in the making of Israeli art music. Moving to consider the dislocation of modern Jewish art music the book examines the paradoxes embedded in a Zionist national culture whose rhetoric negated its pasts, only to mask process of hybridizations enchained by older legacies. \"Jewish Contiguities\" has won the 2015 Engle Prize for the study of Hebrew Music, and the 2016 Jordan Schnitzer Book Award. Context_7 : Vocal harmony is a style of vocal music in which a consonant note or notes are simultaneously sung as a main melody in a predominantly homophonic texture. Vocal harmonies are used in many subgenres of European art music, including Classical choral music and opera and in the popular styles from many Western cultures ranging from folk songs and musical theater pieces to rock ballads. In the simplest style of vocal harmony, the main vocal melody is supported by a single backup vocal line, either at a pitch which is above or below the main vocal line, often in thirds or sixths which fit in with the chord progression used in the song. In more complex vocal harmony arrangements, different backup singers may sing two or even three other notes at the same time as each of the main melody notes, mostly with consonant, pleasing-sounding thirds, sixths, and fifths (although dissonant notes may be used as short passing notes). Context_8 : David Wallis Reeves (February 14, 1838 – March 8, 1900), also known as D. W. Reeves or Wally Reeves, was an American composer, cornetist, and bandleader. He developed the American march style, later made famous by the likes of John Philip Sousa, and his innovations include adding a countermelody to the American march form in 1876. Sousa called Reeves \"The Father of Band Music in America\", and stated he wished he himself had written Reeves' \"Second Regiment Connecticut National Guard March\". Charles Ives also borrowed from the \"Second Connecticut\" on four occasions. Context_9 : \"Indian classical music is one of many forms of art music that have their roots in particular regional cultures. For other \"classical\" and art music traditions, see List of classical and art music traditions.\" Context_10 : Progressive music is music that subverts genre and expands stylistic boundaries outwards. Rooted in the idea of a cultural alternative, musical progressiveness embodies a continuous move between explicit and implicit references to genres and strategies derived from various cultural domains, such as European art music, Celtic folk, West Indian, or African. The word \"progressive\" comes from the basic concept of \"progress\", which refers to development and growth by accumulation, and is often deployed in numerous music genres such as progressive country, progressive folk, progressive jazz, and (most significantly) progressive rock. fact_1 :  Charles Ives also borrowed from the \"Second Connecticut\" on four occasions. fact_2 : Charles Edward Ives ( ; October 20, 1874May 19, 1954) was an American modernist composer. fact_3 :  He combined the American popular and church-music traditions of his youth with European art music, and was among the first composers to engage in a systematic program of experimental music, with musical techniques including polytonality, polyrhythm, tone clusters, aleatory elements, and quarter tones, foreshadowing many musical innovations of the 20th century.

Context_2 : \"Palisades Park\" is a song written by Chuck Barris and recorded by Freddy Cannon. A tribute to New Jersey's Palisades Amusement Park, it is an up-tempo rock and roll tune led by a distinctive organ part. The track also incorporates amusement park sound effects, including the sounds of screaming riders on the roller coasters, and the quoting of a slower version of the \"March of the Clowns\", played on an organ imitating a Hurdy Gurdy or Caliope. In the song, the singer takes a walk after dark and discovers Palisades Park, where he meets and falls in love with a girl. Among the list of rides and attractions listed in the song are: \"Shoot the Chute, Rocket Ship, Roller Coaster, Loop the Loop, Merry Go Round, Tunnel of Love, and the Ferris Wheel. Context_3 : William J. Dorgan (November 9, 1921 - October 11, 2003) was an American Republican Party politician who served in the New Jersey General Assembly, as Mayor of Palisades Park, New Jersey, and as a member of the Bergen County Board of Chosen Freeholders. Dorgan was born on November 9, 1921 in Cliffside Park, New Jersey, the son of William and Julia Dorgan. He graduated from St. Cecilia High School and attended Seton Hall University. Dorgan served for seven years as the Mayor of Palisades Park, and for three years as a Bergen County Freeholder. He was elected Assemblyman in 1969. He was not a candidate for re-election in 1971. Context_4 : The Palisades Park Public School District is a comprehensive community public school district that serves students in kindergarten through twelfth grade from Palisades Park, in Bergen County, New Jersey, United States. Context_5 : Koreatown, Palisades Park, also known as the Palisades Park Koreatown (Hangul:팰리세이즈 파크 코리아타운, shortened to 팰팍), in the borough of Palisades Park, Bergen County, New Jersey, United States, in the New York City Metropolitan Area, is one of the largest and fastest growing ethnic Korean enclaves outside of Korea. Koreans comprise the majority (65%) of the population of the borough of Palisades Park, the municipality with the highest density of ethnic Koreans in the Western Hemisphere and the home of both the highest Korean-American density and percentage of any municipality in the United States. Koreatown, Palisades Park has been nicknamed the \"Korean village\" and \"Koreatown on the Hudson\". Context_6 : Palisades Park Junior / Senior High School is a five-year comprehensive public high school that serves students in eighth through twelfth grades from Palisades Park, in Bergen County, New Jersey, United States, operating as the lone secondary school of the Palisades Park Public School District. Context_7 : Palisades Park is a 26.4-acre park in Santa Monica, California. The park is located along Ocean Avenue on top of the coastal sandstone bluffs, offering breathtaking scenic views of the Pacific Ocean and the coastal range. It extends over 1.5 mi from the Santa Monica Pier at its southern end to Adelaide Drive at its northern end. It is lined with more than 30 varieties of plants and trees, including eucalyptus, pine, palm, and fig trees. Context_8 : Route 5 is a 3.18-mile (5.12 km) state highway located entirely in Bergen County, New Jersey, United States. It runs from U.S. Route 1/9 in Ridgefield east down the New Jersey Palisades to end at County Route 505 (River Road) at the Hudson River in Edgewater.

Barris was known for hosting \"The Gong Show\", and creating \"The Dating Game\" and \"The Newlywed Game\". He was also a songwriter, who wrote \"Palisades Park\" for Freddy Cannon. Barris wrote an autobiography titled \"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\", which was made into the film of the same name directed by George Clooney. Context_10 : Luna Park was one of several names for an amusement park that existed in Rexford, New York, near Schenectady, from 1901 to 1933. In addition to Luna Park (the name given by developer/entrepreneur Frederick Ingersoll when he added rides and assumed control of Rexford Park in 1906), it was also known as Dolle's Park (named after Fred Dolle, who bought the park from Ingersoll in 1912), Colonnade Park, Palisades Park, and (again) Rexford Park (in 1916) before the rides were dismantled in 1933. Constructed around the Grand View Hotel (built and opened by Jacob Rupert in 1901), the park was similar to Ingersoll's other Luna Parks in which it was a trolley park with roller coasters, picnic pavilions, carousels, a fun house, a roller rink, a concert shell, a dance hall, a midway, a Whip, and a shoot-the-chutes ride which presented itself at the park entrance adjacent to a station of the Van Vranken electric trolley line. Roughly seven decades before the Skycoaster rides that now dot various United States amusement parks, Luna/Rexford Park featured an aerial swing ride. fact_1 : \"Palisades Park\" is a song written by Chuck Barris and recorded by Freddy Cannon. fact_2 :  Barris wrote an autobiography titled \"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\", which was made into the film of the same name directed by George Clooney. Answer: Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\nOutput:\nWhat book did the writer of the song Palisades Park write?\n\nInput:\nContext_1 : \"Make It\" is the first song on Aerosmith's self-titled debut album, \"Aerosmith\". It was released as a promo single for the album, but got little to no airplay. The song begins with the protagonist welcoming people to a show and tells them he has something they should know, the info in question is to make it and not break it, which means to succeed in achieving your dreams and not letting anything stop you (much like Aerosmith in their early club days performing up to three shows a day trying to get a Context_2 : Witchcraft Destroys Minds & Reaps Souls is the debut studio album by the American psychedelic rock band Coven. Released in 1969, it was unusual in that it dealt with overtly occult and satanic themes, and was removed, in the past time, from the market soon after its release due to controversy. However, it remains a classic of its genre, and in some ways set groundbreaking trends for later rock bands. This album marked the first appearance in music of the sign of the horns, inverted crosses, and the phrase Hail Satan. Today, these are characteristics of the occult and heavy metal genres. According to rock journalist Lester Bangs, \"in England lie unskilled laborers like Black Sabbath, which was hyped as a rockin' ritual celebration of the Satanic mass, something like England's answer to Coven\". As a further coincidence, Coven's bass guitarist and co-writer (Mike Osborne) is credited as \"Oz Osborne\", and the opening track is \"Black Sabbath\". Context_3 : \"Hail, Hail\" is a song by the American rock band Pearl Jam. Featuring lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music co-written by guitarist Stone Gossard, bassist Jeff Ament, and guitarist Mike McCready, \"Hail, Hail\" was released in 1996 as the second single from the band's fourth studio album, \"No Code\" (1996). The song managed to reach the number nine spot on both the Mainstream Rock and Modern Rock \"Billboard\" charts. The song was included on Pearl Jam's 2004 greatest hits album, \"rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991–2003)\". Context_4 : \"Thank God for Believers\" is a song co-written by Mark Alan Springer, Roger Springer and Tim Johnson and was recorded by the American country music singer Mark Chesnutt. It was released in July 1997 as the title track and first single from his album \"Thank God for Believers\". It peaked at number 2 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart and number 7 on the Canadian \"RPM\" Country Tracks chart. Context_5 : \"True Believers\" is a song co-written recorded by American country music artist Darius Rucker. It was released in August 2012 as his first single and title track from his album \"True Believers\". Rucker wrote the song with Josh Kear. Context_6 : \"Nobody's Fault\" is a song by American hard rock band Aerosmith. It is the sixth track on Aerosmith's fourth studio album \"Rocks\", released in 1976. It was written by guitarist Brad Whitford and lead singer Steven Tyler. Whitford often cites it as his favorite Aerosmith song. Context_7 : Big Satan (sometimes erroneously called I Think They Liked It Honey) is a live album by saxophonist Tim Berne's Big Satan which was recorded in 1996 and released on the Winter & Winter label. Context_8 : \"Walk This Way\" is a song by the American hard rock band Aerosmith. Written by Steven Tyler and Joe Perry, the song was originally released as the second single from the 1975 album \"Toys in the Attic\". It peaked at number 10 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in early 1977, part of a string of successful hit singles for the band in the 1970s. In addition to being one of the songs that helped break Aerosmith into the mainstream in the 1970s, it also helped revitalize their career in the 1980s when it was covered by rappers Run–D.M.C. on their 1986 album \"Raising Hell\". This cover was a touchstone for the new musical subgenre of rap rock, or the melding of rock and hip hop. It became an international hit and won both groups a Soul Train Music Award for Best Rap – Single in 1987. Context_9 : \"Hail Satan\", sometimes expressed in a Latinized version as \"Ave Satanas\" (or \"Ave Satana\"), is an expression used by some Satanists to show their dedication to Satan, but has also been used for the purpose of comedy or satire. Believers in backmasking think they can hear \"Hail Satan\" and other messages to Satan in some songs played in reverse, such as \"Walk This Way\" by Aerosmith. The variation \"Ave Satani\", though grammatically incorrect, is sometimes used, likely originating from its use by Jerry Goldsmith in his theme music to \"The Omen\". Context_10 : Three Chord Country and American Rock & Roll is the debut album of American country music artist Keith Anderson. It features the singles \"Pickin' Wildflowers\", \"XXL\", \"Every Time I Hear Your Name\", and \"Podunk\", all of which charted in the Top 40 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Songs charts. A remixed version of the title track, featuring Steven Tyler of the rock band Aerosmith, was to have been released as the album's fourth single (following \"Every Time I Hear Your Name\"), but this single mix was withdrawn before it could chart, and replaced with \"Podunk\" as the fourth single. The album has been certified gold in the United States by the RIAA. Jeffrey Steele produced the album except for the title track, which was produced by John Rich of Big & Rich. fact_1 :  Believers in backmasking think they can hear \"Hail Satan\" and other messages to Satan in some songs played in reverse, such as \"Walk This Way\" by Aerosmith. fact_2 :  Written by Steven Tyler and Joe Perry, the song was originally released as the second single from the 1975 album \"Toys in the Attic\".

An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \"*\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.\n\nDid M1 's director , cinematographer , producer , and executive producer produce , executive produce , direct , and write M0\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "SELECT count(*) WHERE {\n?x0 ns:film.cinematographer.film M1 .\n?x0 ns:film.director.film M0 .\n?x0 ns:film.director.film M1 .\n?x0 ns:film.producer.films_executive_produced M0 .\n?x0 ns:film.producer.films_executive_produced M1 .\n?x0 ns:film.producer.film|ns:film.production_company.films M0 .\n?x0 ns:film.producer.film|ns:film.production_company.films M1 .\n?x0 ns:film.writer.film M0\n}"}]}

Your task is to generate the question for the answer based on the given article.\n\nInput:\nArticle: Lawmakers in the United States have expanded an investigation into the use of location-tracking systems on mobile devices. The action follows recent reports about the storing of information on the Apple iPhone. Some people consider location tracking to be a threat to personal privacy and security. Allan Friedman, the research director, says, \"All wireless companies do some location tracking as part of their networks. This information is usually stored by the companies, not the devices, and there are laws to protect it. Law enforcement  agencies, for example, have to have a fairly high standard before it can access that data. And the phone company is also prohibited from selling that information. Now, two researchers report that location tracking information is being stored directly on Apple devices. They said Apple's newest operating systems gather global positioning system and timestamp information. The information is stored on the device in a file that is also uploaded   to any computer that the device is connected to. The researchers say the information is available to anyone who has access to the device or computer. Allan Friedman says, \"This raises additional concerns. There's the idea that because it's on my phone and on my computer, rogue applications  that I pay for or that I'm tricked into downloading may be able to access this data and somehow misuse it.\" Apple says it is \"not tracking the location of your iPhone\". It is simply keeping a database of Wi-Fi hotspots and cell phone towers near the user's location. This information is meant to help the iPhone quickly find its location when needed.\nLetters have been sent to some of the leading mobile device developers, including Apple and Google. The letters asked for more information about their location tracking systems. Allan Friedman calls this an important start to strengthening privacy laws. He says, \"There aren't strong controls over things like location information, what they are doing with it, how long they are keeping it. And perhaps the most important question is, is my location data with other facts about me?\" \n Answer: Because it is thought to threaten users' privacy.\nOutput:\nWhy did American lawmakers investigate the use of location-tracking systems on cell-phones?\n\nInput:\nArticle: There are a lot of public libraries in Britain. These libraries have more than one hundred and fifteen million books, not including those libraries of public schools. Public libraries not only lend books, music records but also help children, patients in hospitals and others to get special play readings, film shows and so on. The first public libraries were founded in about the year 1850. Today's public libraries usually have a reading-room, a lending room and a reference room. The greatest and most famous library in Britain is that of the British Library in London. It was founded in 1973 and has over 10, 000, 000 books. It has nearly every magazine, newspaper and book published in Britain and other parts across the world. \n Answer: 10,000,000 or less.\nOutput:\nHow many books are there in the British Library?\n\nInput:\nArticle: Hollywood is on the edge of a nervous breakdown. Worried about an industry wide writers' strike, struck by a series of theater-chain bankruptcies , burdened with unreasonable corporate profit, requirements and seemingly incapable of producing consistently creative movies, the American film industry is in a period of soul-searching. There's little doubt it will survive this crisis. But most insiders agree there is disease at both ends of the business--where film are produced, and where they're shown---that may take years to overcome. While annual box-office income increases for nine straight years, largely due to increased ticket prices, the number of actual tickets sold declined for the second year in a row. The construction boom has added nearly 10,000 theaters(more than 200,000 more seats) in the last five years. But due to a static audience base, eight major chains have gone into bankruptcy and several others are in terrible financial situations. In fact, insiders say, Hollywood is now in a business it does not want to be in. \"There's a general problem in that the companies that have the most consistent output of material are least interested in what they're making,\" says former 20thCentury Fox CEO, Bill. And, Bill adds, \"We're in a period where movies are getting bigger and more costly and less interesting and fulfilling to an audience.\" Today the studios are under the stress to increase profit margins  for their corporate parents, and profit margins are hard to control in a business whose products are seen as impulse buys . Other business can increase profits by cutting costs--buying cheaper material, or making the candy bar smaller. Not Hollywood. \"What we're cutting is risk,\" says the head of one major studio, who asked not to be named, \"And risk is what great film has always demanded.\" While the studios are avoiding risky concepts, their competitors in the home entertainment business have been expanding the boundaries of the imagination. It was this pressure---in electronic games, the Internet, EVDs----that forced the movie theater chains into a self-destructive craze of expansion. \n Answer: Lack of the advertisement funds\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Which of NOT the worry of the American film industry according to the passage?"}]}
